			<h1>Dirty Harry's Balcony 2.21.15</h1>
			
            <p>
                After dropping Aaron off at the airport for his business trip, Sara and I headed out on I-90 in search of a hike.  For some reason I really didn’t feel like planning anything, which is very unusual for me.  Sara had thrown out Bare Mountain but I didn’t feel like making the hour plus drive on the forest service road, I was hoping for something shorter so I could get home and get some stuff done for school.  I had grabbed my day hiking book for Snoqualmie Pass and she found Dirty Harry’s Balcony, surprisingly something neither of us had hiked before.  It starts near the firefighter training academy at Exit 38.  I had only been over that way once for some rock climbing after work.  We stopped in North Bend on the way so I could grab something for breakfast and then found the empty trailhead.

                I think Sara was hoping for a bigger adventure, more along the lines of climbing Dirty Harry peak, but I was having some weird muscle pains around my ribs and abs, so we took it slow.  We hiked the half mile up the road and found the trailhead.  I was hoping my muscles would loosen up a bit but the weird pain was still there.  Sara strongly suggested I do a bit of stretching, so begrudgingly I did.  The trail heads up an old logging road, very similar to the trail heading up to Defiance and Bandera farther east.  We had the trail to ourselves as we slowly made our way up.  I stopped along the little stream for a snack break, and finally my muscles were starting to feel normal again.

                We continued up the moderately sloped trail through the trees, soon coming to the break in the trail to head to the balcony.  It was marked with a couple of cairns, and there’s a bunch of old cable on the ground there.  I grabbed some more shotbloks and we started out the last quarter mile.

                There was a lot of green moss in the trees and everything was a bit damp.  However, as we started to near the balcony we could see sunshine!  The balcony is a large area of rock, a fairly nice little viewpoint.  The sun was trying to work its way through the clouds over the I-90 corridor.  Sara grabbed a snack and we found some relatively comfortable seats among the rock to relax and enjoy the mountains.

                We somehow managed to get more than a half hour of peace at the balcony before the next hiker arrived.  We figured that was a good reason to pack up and head home.  We met several more groups on the trail up and found an almost full parking lot when we got back to the car.  It was a nice little hike, reminding me a lot of Rattlesnake Ledge, only less people, a bit rockier trail, and not quite as nice of a view.  However, it’s a good alternative for a short hike that’s a bit quieter.  I’ll add Dirty Harry’s Peak to my to-do list now too.
