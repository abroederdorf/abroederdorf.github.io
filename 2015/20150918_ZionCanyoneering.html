			<h1>Zion: Canyoneering 9.18.15</h1>
			
			<p>We woke up at 6:15am to get dressed and grab some breakfast before walking across the street to Zion Adventure company for our guided canyoneering trip. After a quick discussion about our cold level – basically that I am always cold - our guide decided dry suits would be the best bet. I don’t think they had used them for the season yet so he was a little sad that it had come to the time when dry suits were needed, but in the end I’m very glad we made that decision. Not only was I not cold, I also wasn’t wet all day – another hated state of mine. They outfitted us with packs, dry bags, neoprene socks, canyoneering shoes, helmets, harnesses, a personal anchor, piranha rappel device, two ascenders with sling and foot sling, an auto block, dry suit, and coveralls. Aaron had coordinated our trip with the guide company to let them know we are rock climbers but that I’m not super comfortable in water. That way they could figure out a trip where we could learn some cool stuff but wouldn’t be too outside of my skill set.</p>

			<p>Our guide Rob drove us to a canyon that the company owns near the northwest part of Zion. We hiked in about a mile with minimum elevation change and dropped our packs at our entry point. We hiked a bit farther to our exit point to drop the ropes down so we could ascend back out. We changed into our neoprene socks, canyoneering shoes, dry suit, and coveralls before we made the first rappel into the canyon. Rob showed us how to use a plexiglass stick (fiddle stick) in a knot that could be pulled free for rope retrieval. It was pretty cool. He also took some time showing us the different ways to use the piranha rappel device which I also thought was really cool as you can change the amount of friction in the system on the fly.</p>

			<p>I rappelled first into the waist deep pool. There was a big tree and lots of little sticks in there. Immediately I was happy I had a dry suit on. I waited for Aaron to come splashing into the pool second, then Rob last before we made a super short walk to the start of the second rappel. This pothole would require some swimming in an intermediate pool so Aaron went first so I could hear how it went. We rappelled into the intermediate pool. Then as we swam to the edge Rob paid out rope. Once at the edge we let him know and Rob fixed the rope again so we could finish the rappel into the bottom pool. There was a big log floating in the intermediate pool and based on Aaron’s experience he told me not to try and sit on it – apparently it’s quite the log rodeo if you do try to sit on it as it tries to buck you off. I entered the water on one side of the log and did have to push myself over. After that I just stayed on my back and sort of floated/backstroke to the edge – overall not a horrible experience since I’m not a strong swimmer.</p>

			<p>We slid down some rock walls like slides, then did the third and final rappel to reach the exit point. We got to do a mini Tyrolean traverse for no reason other than we could. Rob showed us some knots along the way which was fun. It was nice to be comfortable with the gear, but get to learn new things. After some lunch we continued heading down canyon to do some more exploration.</p>

			<p>There were a bunch of short ropes clipped into the first anchor to help facilitate the down canyon exploration. Most were pretty short rappels into some water. Down canyon had a lot of slippery mud so I fell several times. There was also some dead wildlife we walked by – one dead mouse floating in a pothole, and another dead bird on the mud. I’m assuming a result from all of the recent storms.</p>

			<p>I stopped after the fourth rappel as the next pool was deep enough to require another swim. I wasn’t up for a second swim and was worried about having the strength to ascend all of the ropes back out, so Aaron and Rob did two more rappels to do a bit of exploring. Aaron reminded me how to ascend on the way up as Rob pulled and coiled the ropes we used along the way. After the first ascent I got into a rhythm for the next three, which was good before tackling the long ascent out of the canyon.</p>

			<p>Back at our packs we took off the dry suits and coveralls and tried to shove all of our gear back into our packs. We were in a lot of water throughout the day so I was very happy to have the dry suit. The final challenge was a long ascent out of the canyon. With my heavy pack from the water logged items, I hung it from my belay loop so I could maneuver my upper body without the weight. I had to take several breaks but I eventually made it. We hiked back to where we left our shoes and then made the mile hike back to the car.</p>
