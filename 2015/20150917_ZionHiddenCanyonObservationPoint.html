			<h1>Zion: Hidden Canyon and Observation Point 9.17.15</h1>
			
			<p>We woke up just before 8am to good weather. Aaron made oatmeal for breakfast and we got ready for a bigger day of hiking in Zion. We left camp a little after 10am, took the Springdale shuttle to the park, and then hopped on the Zion shuttle to the Weeping Rock bus stop. I had wanted to go to Hidden Canyon, and if you continued farther up the trail you reach Observation Point – so we decided to do both for a full day adventure. According to the hiking guide, Hidden Canyon was 2.4 miles round trip with 850 feet of elevation gain and Observation Point was 8 miles round trip with 2148 feet of elevation gain. </p>

			<p>After a quick stretch and some snickering at the signs warning us of the dangers ahead, we started up another paved trail. At the fork a little ways up we took a right to branch off on the trail to Hidden Canyon. A few more switchbacks brought us up most of the elevation gain, then we just had a few corners to navigate with four sets of chains to help. </p>

			<p>We reached the mouth of the canyon and immediately noted the steps carved into the rock to head up canyon and do some exploring. We followed the sand and rock at the base of the canyon and marveled at the walls extending above us. There were some trees along the side, and some little rock scramble steps intermixed with small pools.</p>

			<p>We went for a while and when we reached a pool with a sloping rock ramp, I decided I had seen enough and we turned around. I was getting hungry and we had a long hike ahead of us to reach Observation Point. We went back the way we came, finding more people, and stopped at the original fork in the trail to enjoy some lunch.</p>

			<p>We had spotted part of the upper trail to Observation Point cut into some white rock high above but most of the trail was hidden from sight, as we’d soon find out. We started up the switchbacks, soon passing through a canyon, or just above the canyon. It reminded me of a crevasse a little with the gaping hole in the earth/rock. Once past the canyon it was up lots of switchbacks winding up the backside, the part of the trail we couldn’t see before.  There was little shade and the hike seemed to go on forever.</p>

			<p>Finally we reached the switchbacks in the white rock that we had spotted from below. As we were just starting the traverse we saw our camp neighbors and they gave us the good news that it was another half mile to the end and relatively flat. The very last part wound through a tall meadow of desert plants before we were rewarded with the view of the valley below. We spotted Angels Landing and the unique ridge we hiked on the day before. </p>

			<p>We made some friends on top, had a snack, and headed down. I was really looking forward to being back at camp. We hurried down the trail without much incident and caught the bus. We rode it to the end to complete our bus riding experience, and then headed for the entrance and camp.</p>
