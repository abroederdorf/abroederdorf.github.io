			<h1>2015 Year in Review</h1>

			<p>2015 was a different year for us as I started attending school in addition to my full time job, which meant my free time was greatly reduced. I took 6 classes over the four quarters and with short breaks in between quarters, I still managed to do a few things but nothing in comparison to the past few years. Luckily we spent our honeymoon camping across Utah and hiking in several of the beautiful National Parks.</p>

			<p>Skiing in early 2015 was fairly non-existent. If it weren't for volunteering with Outdoors For All, I'm not sure I would have gotten any additional ski days in. I had one day of training and then made it to five days of the program to ski with participants. All of the skiing was at Stevens with very low snow conditions and lots of ice. Daisy certainly was different from past years! With the low snow my newish powder skis stayed in the garage and my backcountry gear never came out.</p>
			<p>I finished up my fall quarter the second week of December so Aaron and I spent that weekend in Whistler celebrating the end of my quarter and my birthday, slightly belated. The snow was great up there but I was not in shape. They got 14" overnight before our second day too! The next weekend we did a very short backcountry day at Summit East before the resort opened. That was probably my favorite day of backcountry skiing in the 12"+ of new snow. We spent a day at Baker too, with poor visibility but virtually no lines which was amazing. 2015 ended with a ski day at Stevens, again with surprisingly short lines we were heading home by 1:30pm after getting 20 runs in. I figure I won't have much time when my winter quarter starts, so I'm happy we got several days of skiing in with all of the snow we've gotten this year.</p>

			<p>My gym climbing was very sporadic per my schedule. I did a better job of getting in the gym in the earlier part of the year when I didn't have as much wedding planning to take care of in addition to work and school. As the year continued I spent less and less time in the gym. I'm not sure that's going to improve in the new year, but hopefully I get in a few times still. With my sporadic climbing, I wasn't able to maintain any shape and so had to start over every time trying to find my grip strength. At least I got to the gym though!</p>

			<p>We flew down to Austin, TX for one of my college roommates wedding at the beginning of April so we took an extra day and did some rock climbing at Reimer’s Ranch. The routes we found were fairly short so we got a bunch in without dying too much from the heat. Between my spring and summer quarter we escaped for a weekend to the North Cascades and climbed Liberty Bell finally, a fun route and it felt great to be out in the mountains. I took another Saturday off in July to climb the Tooth with Aaron and Luke. I got the honors of leading it all but Aaron had to help carry my pack out as the heat took its toll on me.</p>
			<p>I didn’t get back out on any rock until after my summer quarter. One of the perks of having the wedding in Wenatchee was playing a little in Leavenworth in between planning things. We went out to buy local wine one weekend and managed to get a few routes in before spending the hot afternoon tubing on the Wenatchee River. We also volunteered to help with the BRC graduation climb and due to fires and the forecast, ended up spending a day climbing in Leavenworth in which I finally led all of the pitches of R&D. Outdoor climbing is a bit harder to get to versus the gym so we’ll see how much I get to do in 2016.</p>

			<p>I felt like I didn’t get out to hike but I actually did a fairly good job of doing some close to Seattle hiking along I-90 in the first half of the year. Getting a few free hours here and there allows for some quick hikes. I just have to remember being out in the mountains is worth the drive over spending that time in the gym. Hopefully I’ll be able to find some quick hiking partners here and there to help encourage me, when I get some free time. We did climb Green Mountain to the lookout which was a lot of fun and a new area for all of us. Lots of snow on the climb meant we had a great glissade down too. Other than that I did standard hikes along I-90.</p>
			<p>For our honeymoon we spent just under a week and a half driving across Utah, hiking in the national parks. It was a lot of fun following three quarters of school and all of the time and effort spent on wedding preparation and planning. We started in Zion and spent two days hiking in the park, followed with a third day of a guided canyoneering adventure which was fun. Our next stop was Bryce Canyon which was beautiful, the Hoodoos are unlike anything else. The hike wasn’t too challenging but we did get to see much of the canyon and lots of Hoodoos. </p>
			<p>We drove through Capitol Reef National Park on our way to Moab where we spent our first day at Canyonlands at Island in the Sky. There we did a bunch of really short hikes to see different parts of the park. I really liked the views of the surrounding Mesas, it certainly did feel like we were on an island in the sky. Our last full day we spent at Arches and did a few hikes to see a ton of arches. Delicate Arch was our first destination and I think the best arch. We did a couple more hikes after that, seeing a total of 10 arches that day. Our last day before hitting the road we took a hot air balloon ride over Arches National Park which was a lot of fun.</p>

			<p>I didn’t get out for any running this year. Without being able to keep up with any regularity, I opted instead to take walks around the neighborhood to get out and get some exercise. It was fun finding different routes, especially the streets that had lots of friendly cats. It takes a bit longer to do any distance but I can always head out for a walk to get some exercise, it’s such an accessible form of exercise. I’m not sure I’ll get any running done in 2016 but I’ll certainly continue going for walks to enjoy the sunshine and fresh air!</p>
