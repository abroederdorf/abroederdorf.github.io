			<h1>Leavenworth - Mountaineer's Dome 8.23.15</h1>
			
			<p>
			We camped in Leavenworth for the weekend with the intention of spending the first day in Wenatchee for wine tasting to buy wine for the wedding in a few weeks, then play on the second day with a bit of rock climbing and tubing on the Wenatchee River in the afternoon. After a successful day of wine tasting and purchasing on Saturday, we slept in a bit on Sunday at the Eightmile campground, then went into town for breakfast at Louie's Cafe. We settled on Mountaineer's Dome for some rock climbing, something close to the road and it was open.

			I led the two easy cracks at Mountaineer's Dome, the 5.4 and 5.6. It felt good to place some gear and climb a couple of cracks. Gloria followed and cleaned the route, while Aaron climbed last and cleaned the anchors. Then we went around the corner to the 5.9 roof and I helped Aaron set the top rope with a redirect for the climber. Aaron was first up as the rest of us tried to figure out the route. Gloria went next and made it, while I went last.
			</p>

			There was a fingertip ledge inside the crack which helped, but it was all about the flexibility and trying to get my legs up. After several bruises I finally made it. We had reservations for tubing with Blue Sky Outfitters that afternoon so we headed into town to change and meet for the bus ride out to the river. It was actually a lot of fun to spend the afternoon on the river. More hot climbing days may end a bit early in the future for some lazy tubing, we shall see.
