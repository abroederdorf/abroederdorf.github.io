			<h1>Hidden Lake Lookout 6.21.15</h1>
			
			<p>
			We woke up about 7:30am and slowly got going to pack up camp. We left the Lone Fir campground a little after 8am and stopped at the Washington Pass Overlook. One of those things I pass all the time and never take the time to check out, so we did that morning. A very short walk brings you to the overlook with of course spectacular views of the Liberty Bell Group and other mountains off of the hairpin turn east of the pass. Then it was back in the car for the couple hour drive to the Hidden Lake Lookout. We drove about 10 miles on the Cascade River road out of Marblemount before following the sign pointing us up a road to the Hidden Lake Lookout trailhead.

			I spotted a truck coming down the road so we waited for them to reach the main road before heading up. There is a sign at the beginning that warns of a steep and narrow road – they aren’t kidding. There are a few sections you could probably maneuver a turnout to let a car pass, but mostly I was thankful to have not met a car on the way up or down. The initial part of the road is pretty rough and there are some good potholes at some of the switchbacks. There is a bit of a washout that was well marked about 2.5 miles up the road. I was happy to have a car with clearance. We arrived to a few cars at the trailhead already. After applying a generous coat of sunscreen, we grabbed our light day hiking packs – at least in comparison to our climbing gear the day before - and headed up the trail.
			</p>
			<p>
			The first part passes through the trees in the shade, and over lots of streams. I had done this hike back in 2008 but on a day that we hiked through a cloud – I couldn’t even see the lake below. I don’t remember all of the wooden walkways through the trees, but there are a lot of them. I vaguely remembered leaving the trees, crossing the stream, switchbacking up the side, and then traversing over to the base of the lookout.

			We exited the trees and started finding our way through the jungle of a meadow. I had hiked it in October I think and it certainly wasn’t like this. The grass and plants along the trail felt shoulder high and often times were obscuring the trail. The front person called out any hazards they found since they weren’t always easy to spot – several roots tripped us up. Unfortunately by barreling through the tall foliage, I was knocking pollen loose like crazy and Aaron was suffering the consequences. I asked him a bunch of times if he wanted to turn around – hiking isn’t his favorite and then add in not being able to breath – but he was a trooper and we continued up.

			Finally we were up the switchbacks and crossed the stream again a couple of times. We were out of the ridiculously tall vegetation and among the small bushes and trees that I had envisioned for the whole hike. Without the constant bombardment from pollen, Aaron started feeling better as we made the long traverse. I didn’t remember it being so long, or over so many rocks. We found lots of cairns to help lead the way, and finally spotted the lookout above us. I didn’t take a ton of pictures on the way up due to expedience through the pollen, but the views were amazing. We saw Mount Baker and just seeing all of the surrounding mountains was good motivation.

			As we neared the saddle above the lake, we encountered a few more patches of snow. The trail would disappear under the snow so we’d follow the bootpack, or make our own to where we could see another melted out section. The final stretch up to the saddle was solid snow alongside a slab of rock.

			We made some passing comments with a couple resting before heading down as we followed the trail up to the lookout. 2008 me remembered it as a scramble, but it was mostly just a trail with a few scrambling moves near the top. The dirt trail is pretty easy to follow up, and when you reach the giant boulders just below the top, scramble the path of least resistance. There was a large group and another pair up there already, but luckily there are lots of rocks to layout on so we could all have our own space. We checked out the fire lookout, the first lookout Aaron has been inside. The views were amazing!

			After we signed the book, we found our own boulders to sit on for our summit snacks. Aaron was certainly feeling better at this point as he went scrambling up the tallest point of rock. I elected to stay put and apply more sunscreen. I walked around the summit a bit, taking pictures of all the views. The last time I was in a cloud so I was excited to see everything I had missed.

			After I had taken lots of pictures, we started back down the trail after a short summit break. We made decent time down, encountering a few more groups headed up.

			Knowing what to expect heading through the meadow this time, Aaron led so at least he wasn’t in my trail of pollen. I also told him to run if he needed to and wait in the trees for me. I kept up pretty closely though, lagging a bit as we neared the trees. One of the fun things about the trail was all of the butterflies. When you’d get close they’d take to the air, it felt like you were hiking through a butterfly house.

			Finally we made it back to the trees, happy to be out of the jungle of flowers and grass. We took one quick break on some stumps so I could rest my knees, then pushed to the car. It was a good hike with gorgeous views, but we were happy to be back and on our way to BBQ in Marblemount, followed by an ice cream stop at Cascadian Farms. It was a somewhat low key weekend with our objectives not being overly difficult or challenging, but it was really nice to get out in the mountains and climb together. I’ve apparently been doing a better job than I expected of ignoring the call of the mountains during school, so getting the opportunity to spend an entire weekend reminded me of a few things:
			</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Sleeping in the mountains is amazing - going to bed when the sun goes down or even before that. I certainly don’t get 10 – 12 hours of sleep at home, so maybe I should plan a few more camping trips to catch up on sleep.</li>
				<li>The mountains are my happy place. There’s a peace that they bring and I can’t help but smiling while I admire all of the gorgeous views, and those views never get old.</li>
				<li>Adventures with climbing partners are the best. Whether they are filled with good or bad/ease or challenge, you can’t duplicate the unique experience you get every time you head out, even if it’s to a familiar area on a route you’ve done a thousand times before. And it’s always better to laugh at yourself tripping over things with someone else.</li>
			</ul>
