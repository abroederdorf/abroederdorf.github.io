We were heading down to Austin to celebrate one of my college roommates getting married, so we decided to head down a day early and check out some of the local climbing. Luke and Aubrey were also heading down to Austin to celebrate Aubrey’s birthday so we teamed up on Friday and went to Reimer’s Ranch, west of Austin. The forecast was calling for potential thunderstorms around 1pm so we tried to get there earlier, arriving at the parking lot within a half hour of the park opening. We were the only car and after figuring out which direction to head to get to the climbing area, we hit the trail.

Within a couple of minutes we hit this canyon with a stream running down it. We referenced the book again and finally figured out that we needed to follow that down to the climbing areas. The water made the rock a bit slick but it was kind of cool to head down. We popped out by this huge roof with stalactites and crazy formations, and definitely spotted some draws heading across the roof. We were in search of some easy climbs to get acquainted with the rock so we continued down the trail through the trees. I heard a river so I ran down the trail and found that while the guys started scoping out the rocks, trying to find Dead Cats wall which seemed to have a bunch of easy climbs to start on.

We finally found the area and managed to match a route up to the picture in the climbing guide we had picked up locally the night before. I decided to start by leading the 5.5 as marked in the book, Lessa the Puramatic 6000 Kitty, while Luke picked another nearby route that looked pretty straightforward but wasn't in the book (from what we could tell anyways). I started up and clipped the first bolt, soon to have a herd of spiders spreading out across the rock. I did indeed shriek. Spiders in theory don’t bother me if it’s one that I can kill and isn't a monster, but there were tons of these. I grabbed the draw as I tried to swipe and blow them away. The climb went like this: I would step somewhere new and send the herd scurrying, then I'd grab the draw and try to blow them away from me. For being a 5.5 the route was bit trickier than I was expecting with downward sloping holds, but I finally reached the bomber flake and topped out. Aaron led the route after me, then we switched with Luke and Aubrey.

Next we climbed some unnamed routes that were easy and fun with lots of knobs to grab and stand on, probably 5- each. The first one was really straightforward while the second one topped out via this smooth ramp, a bit challenging. I’d soon learn that was a theme of this area, difficult top outs to the anchor. Aaron led the next route, probably a 5.6, but it &nbsp;(the finish) looked a bit trickier so I just followed him and top roped. Next Luke led a route that ended in a very smooth corner requiring a bit of stemming, probably a 5.7. When I top roped it, the bottom was certainly straightforward but I slipped a bit up high while trying to stem.

<p>
Just before lunch Aubrey and I eyed an easy climb another group had done, another 5-. It was only two bolts but the jugs felt like I was in the gym, Aubrey even found one she likened to the telephone hold. Easy climbing can be fun and I certainly enjoyed myself. By lunch I had led 4 routes and top roped another 2.

After lunch we moved right along the wall to where some groups had just left and Luke and Aaron worked on putting up some harder routes. Aaron started on Scott’s Pelotas (5.8) with a challenging start and equally challenging finish. This section of rock had lots of little finger pockets which worked well with my strengths. It was a fun climb, the first one of the day I really had to think about to find the moves. The guys switched leads so next I followed Aaron on Hello Kitty (5.10a), definitely a challenging climb. The start was thin but there were still plenty of little finger pockets. The crux was pulling over a ledge to reach the final anchor. I took once about 2/3’s up to rest a bit, then pulled through the final moves.

<p>
Next, the guys each led Madrone (5.9). I felt this was the most challenging climb of the day personally. It did a little bit of traversing and there was a lack of the finger pockets I had been enjoying, instead requiring me to grip some large rock. The grip holds are definitely not my strength, added to this being my 9th climb and my hands were starting to get a bit sore from the rock. After some takes and friendly belaying courtesy of Aubrey , I was able to top out.

It was early afternoon and the temperatures were getting a bit warm for us pacific northwesterners. We moved to an easier area so that Aubrey and I could get some more leading in as well, so we went to Zoey’s Wall.  There was a group there working on a route but the easier ones we were after were open. I started on I Never Called You A Beast (5.6). These routes were significantly shorter, 2 – 3 bolts each. It was fairly straightforward and I topped out without too much issue. Next I led Maggie’s Farm (5.6) which called for a knee bar, although I never used one. It was pretty straightforward up to the second bold, but the top out move required a very high step. After thinking it over a moment, I figured out my plan of attack and executed. Last, I led Clambering Kimberly (5.7) after Aaron’s encouragement. It’s a couple of ledges so some mantling was involved. I was able to clip the last bolt but working up from there to finish the route, again the end, was really challenging. I was suppose to head up left to the anchors but couldn't find any good foot holds. A common theme of the rock is that it is down sloping, not the most positive stuff. I spent a long time trying to do a few things. I finally went out right, risking the swing, but eventually climbed straight up and then hand traversed along the ledge to the anchor.

We had planned to leave by 4pm at the latest so that Aaron and I could make it out for some wedding eve drinks, but with the heat and at least 12 climbs under our belts (the guys had more), we figured it was a good time to call it a day. We headed back down to the river and the three dipped their feet in the water. We had brought about 1.5 liters (or 3 bottles) of water per couple so we were out and looked forward to filling up at the parking lot again. There were several more groups climbing as we left and even more coming, but I suppose they’re a lot more used to the heat than we are. It was definitely different rock than we’re used to, and strictly sport climbing, but it was a lot of fun to get out for the day and get a bunch of routes in. The area was beautiful too, making the approach to the climbing area more fun. I still prefer my granite of Leavenworth and Squamish, but reaching outside of my comfort zone is good and can be fun.
