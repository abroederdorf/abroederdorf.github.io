			<h1>Little Bandera 5.23.15</h1>

			<p>
			Aaron’s parents and Alicia were all in town so we wanted to go adventuring in the mountains. Originally I thought Pilchuck would be an ideal hike and none of them had done it, but then the forecast changed from sun to clouds so we decided to save that hike and its amazing views for another adventure. We had to get back with enough time to clean up before heading to the rehearsal dinner that night, so we decided to look for something along I-90 instead. We finally decided on Mason Lake/Little Bandera with the plan being if we all felt good we’d head up Little Bandera, otherwise we’d hike to the lake. We left the house about 6:45am, picked Alicia up, grabbed some quick breakfast in North Bend, and got to the trailhead just after 8am. The parking lot was already 3/4's full, it would be a busy day on the trail!

			Once everyone was ready we hit the trail about 8:30am. I felt like everyone started off at a running pace so I brought up the rear. We were socked in the clouds, we couldn’t even see the mountains across I-90 from us. Regardless we enjoyed the nice trail, the Ira Spring trail, as we steadily gained elevation through the trees. I pointed out points of interest along the hike from my adventure when I dropped Alicia’s snowshoe on the ridge and had to go find it.

			We finally hit the switchbacks and I knew we’d be breaking out of the trees before too long. We played leap frog a little with a couple of groups, but encountered more after getting above the trees. We stopped for a quick food and water break on the rocks in the meadow. We had finally remembered to thaw some of the venison sticks so we brought those with us – they were delicious! They make me want to go hiking more just so I can eat more.

			After walking along the rocks we came to the fork in the trail. My plan was to turnaround at noon so we could make it to the rehearsal dinner. We hit the fork just after 10am, we were making great time! I don’t think anyone even discussed which objective we’d head towards, we just started up. The trail heading up to the ridge is very steep, so we took our time and eventually gained the ridge.

			The elevation gain backed off as we followed the ridge through the cloud, hoping the next high point we spotted was our destination. Crossing the couple sections of rock on the ridge were very cold without the protection of the trees from the wind.

			Finally we joined a few other groups on the summit and enjoyed some more food. We were still solidly in a cloud so we took a group picture but that was about it for photos. After everyone had rested, we started down around 11:30am, still way ahead of schedule! We took our time heading down the ridge, especially the steep mountainside trail down. There were certainly a lot of people out for such a cloudy day!

			On the way down a couple of guys passing us pointed out our first view of the day, a peek at a rocky peak across the way. We also could just make out Mason Lake as we hiked back down the ridge too.

			<p>
			Once we hit the main trail we cruised back to the car. Despite the lack of views it was still a lot of fun to get out with everyone and get a little exercise in. I also sort of got to see what the area is like in the summer time without snow, although it’ll be another experience still with no snow and views. We had moved so much quicker than I allotted for that we stopped at Dairy Queen on the way home for some ice cream, got some short naps in, and still had plenty of time to get cleaned up and head over to the rehearsal dinner – a great day!
