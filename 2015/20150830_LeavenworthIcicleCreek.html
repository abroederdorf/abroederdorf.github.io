			<h1>BRC Grad Climb in Leavenworth - Icicle Creek 8.30.15</h1>
			
			<p>We volunteered to help out with the graduation climb for BRC. Aaron and I got paired up with Leonard and Kevin. There were fires up along Highway 20 so our normal Washington Pass climbs were out. Instead we were going to attempt a leisurely two day climb of Ingalls, my favorite kind of alpine adventure. Unfortunately the weather wasn't looking very good with a forecast of rain. With the wedding coming up we couldn't reschedule so the group made the best of the forecast and decided to climb on Sunday around Leavenworth. We had talked about Vantage but Kevin and Leonard seemed interested in getting another multipitch climb in so we decided to try Leavenworth first and if it was too wet, we could continue on to Vantage to get them some sport leading.</p>
			<p>We met at the Bothell park and ride at 6:30am and after a stop for some breakfast, we arrived along Icicle Creek about 9am. The rock looked a little wet but not too bad, and the skies looked a bit gray. Waiting for a better weather window a little later in the day, we started at the rock above Classic Crack to let Leonard and Kevin work on building some more gear anchors. After several anchors we moved back up the road to Hammerhead Rock. They both mock led the 5.6 corner crack there, and then Leonard got his first lead in! They also top roped the 5.8/5.10a face climbs next to the corner as a couple of other guys were on the 5.9 crack.</p>
			<p>After everyone got in the climbs they wanted at Hammerhead we moved to Bruce's Boulder for the 5- corner crack, another good route for them to lead. Kevin went first and got his first lead on gear, followed by Leondard. The guys were doing great! We drove in towards town to get signal to check the weather. The guys were thinking R&D sounded like a good multipitch objective but without good bail points, we wanted to ensure we had enough of a weather window. After getting signal and finding a decent enough hourly forecast, we decided to go for it. There was one pair starting up when we arrived so we got to climbing right away.</p>
			<p>The other pair was out climber's right so we went straight up the cracks to below the chimney. Aaron and Leonard had started up first, with myself and Kevin climbing second. We were able to both pass the other pair by starting off on our second picture to tackle the chimney. I've climbed R&D several times but had never led the pitch through the chimney so I finally got to do that. Aaron started off up the triple cracks, leaving a piece in the ramp to help me beach myself when I led it. I didn't actually use the piece to get up on the ramp, but I did clip it. We made the triple cracks a super short pitch since it's questionable if you can reach the top from the bottom of the triple cracks, at least in my experience. I finished up the last pitch, passing a few pockets of water, and we topped out after a couple hours. Kevin and Leonard moved well and efficiently. Desipte the weather ruining our grand plans for a graduation climb, we still had a good day working on skills and climbing rock in Leavenworth.</p>
