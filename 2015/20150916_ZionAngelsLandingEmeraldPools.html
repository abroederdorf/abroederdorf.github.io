			<h1>Zion: Angels Landing and Emerald Pools 9.16.15</h1>
			
			<p>We spent a week and a half road tripping through Utah to check out several national parks. Unfortunately the start of our trip coincided with some big storms in the area. Originally we were going to climb Wheeler Peak located in Great Basin National Park, the second highest mountain in Nevada, but due to the forecast we opted instead for the Lehman Cave tour and a quick scenic drive up to about 10,000’. Cutting our stay at Great Basin National Park short we headed to Zion, our next destination, one night early. </p>

			<p>Luckily the resort had our campsite open that night. As a result of all the storms there was some serious flash flooding occurring in the park and surrounding areas, unfortunately resulting in some fatalities. I had requested a campsite on the river weeks prior when making our reservation so we were told if we weren’t comfortable there (with the high river) we could have another spot. We drove to our campsite and checked out the conditions. The river was certainly high and there was a little erosion along the bank nearby, but our campsite was high above the raging river and we just set our tent up back from the edge of the bank. </p>
			<p>We woke up about 7:45am to some sprinkles still. I checked the forecast and it looked pretty good, except from 11 – 1, so we decided to head into Zion to do some hiking. Aaron made pancakes and we left camp about 10am, to catch the Springdale shuttle to the park. We decided to hike Angels Landing from the Grotto Stop, opting to stay away from any canyons in case it did rain during the day. We caught the Zion shuttle after entering the park via the foot bridge and rode to the fifth stop. After sunscreening, we started up the trail – 5.4 miles round trip with 1400’ of elevation gain. </p>

			<p>The first part of the trail is pretty level, following the Virgin River which was still running high from the storms. Then we gained some elevation as we started up the paved trail. It was interesting hiking on so many paved trails and from a trail maintenance prespective on one of the most popular hikes I understand it, but I much prefer more natural trails especially for the impact on my body, specifically my feet. </p>

			<p>A small level portion at the saddle took us to the backside where we hiked up a ton of little switchbacks, better known as Walters Wiggles. This topped out just a little from the chains and the start of the ridge hike to the end. </p>

			<p>It was slow moving with timid hikers in front of us in line and waiting for people to come down the basically one way path. We didn’t use the chains much, feeling more comfortable on the rock itself. The hike is certainly exposed with several hundred, if not a thousand in some places, foot drop from the ridge. People who are not used to exposure I would fully expect to move cautiously and use the chains, as they should. However, given our experiences with rock climbing and lots of slab traversing, especially from our time in Tuolumne Meadows, we had a very different comfort level. I think it certainly helped move things along as people were able to stay on the chains as we traversed around them. It was interesting to see the damage done to the rock from the chains, so many deep grooves from years of those chains ever so slightly banging into the rock as people use them.</p>

			<p>As we continued the crowd thinned until we didn’t have anyone in front of us and could move at our own pace. There were several groups at the landing when we arrived. Due to the very strong winds, we headed back after a few pictures to find a more sheltered lunch spot. The views of the huge sheer rock faces lining the canyon were pretty incredible. We made better time down the ridge than I expected, there seemed to be fewer people. We made it back to the trailhead in about 2 hours and 45 minutes after starting. </p>

			<p>We walked back to the bus stop and consulted the map, after which we decided to hike to the Emerald Pools as one of the approach options left from the same bus stop. The hike would be about 3 miles and 325’ in elevation gain, a nice cool down after Angels Landing. We hiked to all three pools – middle, upper, and finally the lower. The upper pool was the most fun with a waterfall mist feeding the pool. The hike past the lower pools had us pass under two more misting waterfalls too. The water in the pools was fairly low and not so emerald, but it was fun to check out another part of the park. The trail was certainly busy!</p>
