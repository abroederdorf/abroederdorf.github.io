			<h1>Snoqualmie West Summit Skiing 1-9-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was the second weekend in January and when I was invited for some skiing by Carla and Karan, I thought it sounded like a good idea.  We left Saturday afternoon for some night skiing at Snoqualmie, the West Summit.  We stopped at the Safeway in North Bend and picked up a big sandwich and a bag of chips to share for dinner.  When we got to the resort the lady selling the lift tickets had to mention the unfavorable conditions.  After being reassured by some skiers that the mountain wasn't that bad we got our lift tickets, geared up, and headed for the green run. On our way to the lift I heard this really loud scraping noise - it was a snowboarder coming down the mountain.  I couldn't believe how ridiculously loud he was!  I was starting to doubt this whole skiing thing, but luckily our run was a little better.

			The first time down the mountain I was trying to remember everything I had learned the year before.  I took my time  but made it down the mountain.  Carla mentioned how icy it was but I hadn't really noticed it.  On my second run I paid more attention to what I was skiing over and noticed the large ice chunks I had to cross under the chair lift, definitely the worse conditions I've ever skied on - out of the 5 times I've gone, haha.  I got a helmet for this season but forgot it at home, not a good day to forget it.  Luckily I didn't fall so my noggin' stayed safe. After 8 runs we decided to break for dinner and the sandwich and chips hit the spot.  Hawaiian BBQ chips are so good.  After dinner we went back to the run and I got another 7 in.  After 13 runs I had started feeling a lot more comfortable so the last two runs I tried going down on the otherside of the chair lift and going a little faster, as you can see in the speed plots.  I got up over 17 mph!  That's my biggest thing, is feeling comfortable/confident going fast.  I definitely have to work on my mechanics too, but I feel like I'm holding my own - at least on the green runs.  Despite the unfavorable conditions, I had a lot of fun and am looking forward to going a few more times this season!

			My GPS split the night into two activities so I have two graphs.  The first plot is for runs 1 - 8 and the second plot is for runs 9 - 15.  I also split the runs into a few maps so that they could be more clearly seen.  All 15 on one map just looks like a jumble of lines.
