			<h1>OFA Training 12.11/12 & 12.18/19</h1>
			
			<p>
			I decided to volunteer with Outdoors For All (OFA) this year, after much  discussion with friends about what skills are required.  I've had  friends volunteer the last two years, but I just started skiing two  years ago and felt I needed to gain some skills before I could also help  out.  I've heard nothing but good things about the program so I'm  excited to help out this year.  I'm volunteering at Steven's Pass with  the rest of my friends and the lead volunteers there are awesome - and  the program hasn't even started!  We had a spaghetti kegger before  training started, and I can't wait for the theme every week.  I enjoy  the opportunity to get a little silly and have fun (if the 12 Bars of  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13118">Christmas</a> isn't evidence enough).  Volunteering for OFA consists of a  dryland all day training, and for a first year instructor like myself,  two full weekends of on snow training in the mountains.

			The first weekend is only for the first years and is at Snoqualmie  Pass West Summit.  Luckily we have lots of snow this year so we actually  got to do some skiing.  The first weekend is really spent learning how  to ski (or snowboard for those that choose that).  I'm still not the  strongest skier and really lack the necessary confidence, so it was an  interesting weekend. We started off on a blue run right away, the  highest level I'm currently skiing.  I was definitely the slowest one of  the group and the instructor gave me lots of extra tips which I was  grateful for.  We worked through different drills throughout the  morning.  In the afternoon on the first day we finally started with the  most basic steps - something I wish we would have done to begin with.   As I struggled all morning trying to learn drills I had never done and  improve my technique, I excelled at the wedge and wedge turns since it  was not long ago that I was also doing them.    It was difficult for me  to try and pick up some of the  training because I've never taken a lesson, and therefore don't know a  lot of the common terminology or typical drills.  Although I still have a  lot of progress to make, I was feeling better by the end of the first  day.  The second day it was pouring.  I donned my rain gear from  mountaineering and actually stayed pretty dry.  We only took a few runs  and then spent time talking through things.

			The second weekend was at our program mountain, so for me that meant  Stevens Pass.  This weekend is when the experienced volunteers come  back out to refresh on their instructor skills and get back on the snow.   I really enjoyed skiing at Stevens.  I had skied there twice, my first  two times in Washington when I was just learning and I never ventured  from Daisy, so it was fun to learn about the rest of the mountain.  Our  first run down was a blue with a lot of bumps and my lack of skills,  experience, and confidence came shining through.  My instructor for the  weekend was awesome though, and if the group went through some terrain I  wasn't as comfortable with, he'd either send me another way or ski with  me another way.  After a few runs down Hogsback, we made our way over  to Daisy.  After two years, I  was happy to see I had made a lot of  progress.  I remember those first couple days of being intimidated by  that run - now I can't believe I was!  It was a nice little confidence  boost though, to know that I have actually gotten a bit better.  We  worked on a  lot of the same drills and skills from the weekend before,  just on our mountain now.  Our instructor did tell me I was a nice,  controlled skier - a compliment, even if it means I go too slow!

			After an interesting but fun night in Goldbar, we were back at  Stevens for our last day of training.  We started the morning by  learning about tethering.  I'll be helping instruct students that are  stand up, downhill skiers so tethers can be a useful tool.  I was really  nervous when my turn came, thinking I would never be able to do  something like that.  I surprised myself and actually had a good time  with it!  I used my enginerd skills and physics to really help me see  the path for controlling the tether and to keep the skier going.  During  the morning everyone got to try it on Daisy, and then after lunch we  moved over towards the terrain park and practiced there.  I think  tethering was my favorite part and I really started getting into the  mind set for instructing and helping out.  I had a great time with  training and really appreciated the instruction and time I got on the  snow - I definitely learned a lot and feel like I improved from those  four days. Although a little intimidated still by all the skillful  skiers helping and my lack of skills, I'm really looking forward to  working with the participants and having a lot of fun with them.  It is  interesting that I felt most comfortable on the basic stuff, what we  will most likely be doing with students, while our free runs with the  group are what caused me the most anxiety.  It gives me hope though that  I might actually be able to help out the participants more than giving  them positive encouragement.  The six weeks of the program should be  awesome and I can't wait to be a part of OFA.</p>
