			<h1>Tieton River 9.18.10</h1>
			
			<p>
			Summer flew by and it was already time for the last BEWET rafting trip on the Tieton.  It has become my yearly tradition to go on the Tieton as it's a fun, fast paced river and the weather is usually gorgeous.  Usually being the key word, forecasts unfortunately called for rain that weekend.  The plan was to head down Friday night, camp, raft Saturday, climb when we got off the river, potluck and camp that night, and do some more climbing Sunday before finally heading back to Seattle.  We were planning on the A-team being present too - Aaron N, Aaron P, Alicia B (Biddy), Alyssa, and myself.  We prepared for the worst while keeping hope alive.  Aaron P had a shade canopy that we decided to bring so we could get some shelter from the rain, but we were still bringing our climbing gear.  The first bad news of the weekend struck Friday afternoon when Aaron P found out he was expected to work over the weekend.  Severely bummed, he still lent us some equipment to take with us so the three girls loaded up in the Biddy-mobile and headed for the river.  After a stop in North Bend for food, we were on our way along I-90 - only a 3 hour drive.  We found our way to the campsite at Hause Creek campground just east of Rimrock Lake with no problems and immediately threw on our rain gear as the rain was being relentless.  We set up our couple <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12837">tents</a>, had a drink around the fire, and as most people had already gone to bed, we retired as well - hopeful for some good weather on Saturday.

			We woke up to gray skies but a break in the rain!  We changed into our amazing rafting <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12839">gear</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12841">waited</a> for the crew to get ready.  We were assigned to the smaller raft and we almost pulled off the A-team boat: Aaron, Alicia, Alyssa, and Alicia + a Rachel.  Nonetheless we had an awesome time down the river and Aaron didn't even kill us girls - I guess we must have been civil enough that he could tolerate the 4 of us on his own.  I sat up front on the left and we made it down the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12836">river</a>, passed waffle wall, over the dam and back out all in one piece.  Franklin, the group floatie turtle, even made the trip strapped to the front of our boat.  After we packed up the boat and got all the gear on the truck, it was time to head back to camp.  I was pretty tired so the Alicia's decided to relax at camp while the other half of the A-team went back for another run.  Unfortunately due to all the rain, the rock was most likely wet, squashing our climbing hopes and dreams.  After some reading, chatting, and drying of clothing the rain started back up just after the afternoon crew returned to camp.

			The grill got fired up and the feast ensued - I somehow downed 3 sausages, I guess I was the garbage disposal of the girl crew?!  We sat underneath a massive <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12838">tarp</a> around the campfire and enjoyed the night.  There was some talk about trying to head to Vantage for some climbing on Sunday, but the weather reports we found indicated it had been raining there and more of it was likely so we decided to pack up early-ish in the morning and head back to Seattle.  We woke up and took on the grim task of packing up all the wet gear - the worst part about camping in the rain.  We elected to take the route right past Mt Rainier on the way <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12835">back</a> to Seattle for a slight change in scenery.  We made it back, got the tents spread out for drying, and dried off ourselves.  Despite the bleak weather of the weekend, it was still a good weekend on the river.  Until next June when rafting picks up again!
