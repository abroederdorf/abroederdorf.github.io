			<h1>Leavenworth Clamshell 4-25-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			I got my first real introduction to rock climbing this weekend in Leavenworth and I really enjoyed it, I definitely want to start climbing now.  The seventh Boealps outing was to Leavenworth for a weekend of camping and climbing.  The clubs spring camp trip was this weekend so we loaded up the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10975">Warrior</a> and drove over Friday night to have some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10973">fun</a> with the group.  Saturday morning a bunch of people went climbing, including me.  After talking to some people after class Wednesday, I decided I needed rock shoes so I went to Second Ascent on Thursday before football to pick up a pair.  I got a pair of <a href="http://www.secondascent.com/s/index.php?target=products&amp;product_id=30467">5-10 Gambit</a>.  I was told they are a beginner shoe which sounds right for me.  We camped at 8 mile along <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10985">Icicle Creek</a>, a perfect area for rock climbing.  After sleeping in until about 9, we grabbed some breakfast, said goodbye to Emily, and drove a couple miles down the road to Barney’s Rubble/<a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/leavenworth/icicle_creek/106607114">Bruce’s Boulder</a> which are across the street from each other.</span><br>
			<br>
			There was already a group at Barney’s Rubble but they were really cool about working with us so that both groups had some routes to climb.  One group stayed there and I went with the other to Bruce’s Boulder which had some easy walk up top rope routes.  Meredith, one of my instructors, set up a rope down the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10980">5-6</a> slab climb and what better way to start the day than <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10979">rappel</a> down.  I let her climb first so I could check out the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10982">route</a> while I belayed.  She made it to the top and then it was my turn, my first real rock climbing attempt using my brand new shoes.  It was a pretty easy climb and a great confidence boost.  Next I went up a 5-4 corner which was easy and found a new <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10983">friend</a> when I was about to put my hand down.  Once I reached the top of that route, following Meredith again, we took the rope and set it up for the 5-9 route.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10984">Meredith</a></span> again went first while I belayed, so that I could try and figure out the route.  She made it up and then it was my turn.  I had the hardest time getting started, I think I fell at least 5 times, scraping against the rock.  Meredith would grab onto my harness to help me from swinging back and forth on the rope.  I finally made it past the first part and quickly ascended the crack.  I made it across the ledge and the last little bit was to climb up another crack.  I couldn’t find a good foot hold and fatigue set in.  After trying a few more times, I just had Meredith lower me.  I probably made it 2/3 – 3/4 of the way up, not too bad.  Once down I saw my battered hands and wrists, I had collected some lovely scrapes.  I grabbed some cold pizza in the Warrior for lunch and then <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10987">belayed</a> a few more <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10986">people</a> on a couple of routes before we packed up and went back to the campground.</span><br>
			<br>
			Saturday <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10989">night</a> wasn’t quite as entertaining as Friday, although there was some lassoing going on.  The potluck was Saturday night so I had a very good dinner.  We went to bed a little earlier since we had our actual outing the next day, so we had to report at the trailhead by 7:00 AM.  This weekend I slept where the table is in the Warrior since it is a shorter spot and I fit.  It was awesome because I had it all to myself so I could roll around as much as I wanted, and I was right next to the heater.  It actually was blowing so hot that I had to face away.  After some confusion on trying to find Clamshell, our destination for the day, we started our short hike in.  I guess I was spoiled by Saturday’s climbs and expected something near the road, but we actually had to go about a quarter of a mile and I was breathing hard by the end of it.  I had kept on my fleece because I figured we wouldn’t be doing as much and I would get cold – bad idea.

			After making it to our area for the day, we got our harnesses on and started learning.  We first learned about setting anchors, like using chocks, trees, and horns on rock.  Once we had set up a few anchors, we practiced rappelling past a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10991">knot</a>.  After that we learned how to escape a belay to check on a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10994">hurt climber</a>.  Next we practiced the painful hip belays, finally leading into the really fun stuff for the day.  I started with a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11001">free rappel</a>.  Usually you walk down the rock face in a rappel, but if you have to go beyond an overhang, there is no rock to ‘walk’ down so you just free rappel.  It was pretty cool, but the section of free rappel was pretty short.  Finally I got to try the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11004">Tyrolean Traverse</a>.  A rope is set up to span a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11005">free space</a>.  You create a chest harness using a sling and a caribiner and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11003">hook</a> onto the line using that and as well as your belay loop. We also had an additional personal anchor as a backup.  It was a lot of fun, a little more work than I expected pulling myself across.  We all stopped in the middle for some photos.  We finished our skills early so I did one climb and then belayed a couple more climbers before we packed up and left for dinner.  We ate at Gustav’s in Leavenworth, not my favorite place.  The food was ok but it was mostly an American menu with one German dish.  If I’m in a Bavarian village I want to eat some German food!  It was another great outing and weekend, and I can’t wait to start climbing more.  Unfortunately that will probably have to wait until June when my life frees up a bit.
