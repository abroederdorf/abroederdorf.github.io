			<h1>Mt Si 2-21-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			The weather in Seattle had been beautiful since I returned from California, but I was unfortunately stuck inside at work admiring it everyday, including Saturday.  Sunday was my day and I had set my sights on hiking Mt Si.  Earlier that week on Wednesday, I made a last minute decision to sign up for the <a href="http://www.boealps.org/">Boealps</a> Basic Climbing Class.  Boealps is a mountaineering club.  I'm super excited about the class and all of the things I'm going to learn, as well as adventures I'll get to go on.  Besides rock climbing we do snow camping, self arrest, and crevasse rescue.  During our first class the lead instructor mentioned that for people to be in good enough shape for the class, they should be able to hike to the top of Mt Si in 2 - 2.5 hours.  I had hiked Mt Si the previous Memorial Day but I didn't remember how long it took me, and that was quite a while ago, so I decided to do the hike again to see where I stood in terms of fitness.

			According to my track record, I got a late start.  I arrived at the trailhead just before 10 AM and found a spot in the last row of the parking lot, which was quickly filling up as I geared up for my hike.  I set my GPS up and away I went.  Mt Si is 4 miles up and just over 3000' in elevation gain, so it's a good hike.  I had my music going and enjoyed the weather.  The whole hike is basically through the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10545">trees</a>, but along a well maintained <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10544">path</a>.  Luckily because Mt Si is a very popular hike, and it definitely lived up to that reputation on Sunday.  I unfortunately am not a good constant hiker.  I tend to start going fast and then take lots of short breaks along the way.  There was good signage every 0.5 miles so I knew how much further I had to go.

			I finally reached the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10533">top</a>, in 2 hours and 3 minutes!  I made it in the time period, but I need to work on keeping a steady pace.  I really need to start running again and build up my cardio.  Once I reached the top I had a challenge to find a quiet place among the rocks to sit and enjoy myself.  After taking a few pictures of the amazing, clear view from the top - including a very snowy <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10543">Mt Rainier</a> in the distance - I finally found my way over to some rocks with a view of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10542">Olympics</a> in the distance.  I was excited to see the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10541">skylines</a> too.  I didn't make it to the actual summit because that requires a scramble up <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10540">Haystack</a>.  I settled for a nice lunch break and some reading time.  I sat in the sun to keep warm since the breeze was a little chilly, and enjoyed a 2 hour break.  While I was reading a group of hikers nearby caught my attention when the guy started feeding birds trail mix.  What was so fascinating is that he had them land on his <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10539">hand</a> to get it.  After a while, there was also a small <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10536">plane</a> that kept <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10537">buzzing</a> the top of Mt Si, which of course caught my attention until it finally flew away.  I finally decided it was time to head down so I packed up and started on my way.  I had to get back to Seattle for my first <a href="http://www.underdogseattle.com/dodgeball/teampage.asp?teamchoice=20306&amp;leaguechoice=1463">dodgeball</a> games that night.  It was a great hike and a wonderful opportunity to enjoy some rare, sunny February weather.

			<p>During my long break I finally decided to turn my GPS off to conserve battery, so my hike was segmented into an up portion and a down portion.</p>
