			<h1>Playground Point 10.2.10</h1>
			
			<p>
			The annual Boealps fall campout in Leavenworth was scheduled for the first weekend in October - which also happened to be the first weekend of Oktoberfest.  The weather forecast was calling for sunny days with highs in the 70's - I was excited.  Aaron, Alyssa, and Alyssa's friend Katie were all heading out there in addition to a good chunk of the Boealps crew.  We pulled into the Eightmile campground well after the sun went down, discovering some of the Boealpers kicking squatters out of our group site as we arrived.  We found a great spot for the tent and set up.  Shenanigans ensued Friday night with the arrival of the Winnie.  The 'hot tub' (read huge metal trough) was rigged up on the bench of the picnic table and wooden posts so that it was over the fire to heat up.  The trough was filled, the air compressor was used for bubbles, bathing suits were donned, and the camp hot tub was enjoyed.  We retired for the night shortly after the the hot tub was up and running, so the scene was quite the sight in the morning with a bike now also in the hot tub.

			After some breakfast, we packed into Alyssa's car and headed for the rock.  Aaron was going to do a more difficult climb but that didn't work out so he was stuck with us baby climbers.  The first day was dedicated to Alyssa and I getting our first lead climbs - yes on sport.  Aaron had other friends get their first lead climbs in Leavenworth too so he had the perfect place picked out for us - Playground Point.  After some navigating fun, we found Playground Point.  We immediately setup at <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/leavenworth/icicle_creek/106582181">Hopscotch</a>, the 5-6 that was to be our first lead climb.  Aaron led it first so that <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12884">Alyssa</a> and I could both climb it once on top rope before leading it.  After we got up it, I was the first one to lead with Aaron belaying me.  Alyssa had lead belayed Aaron but I needed a little extra confidence from having Aaron belay me on my first go.  I <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12881">lead</a> that climb like a champ, haha.  No falls and I was up and down in no time.  Next it was Alyssa's turn, and showing more confidence than I, allowed me to lead belay her. She did an equally excellent job with no falls.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12885">Katie</a> also got her first ever rock climb on Hopscotch, a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12874">good</a> day for firsts!
			</p>
			<p>
			Starting to lead climb and with the possibility of a multi-pitch climb, Aaron gave Alyssa and Katie a quick rapelling <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12877">lesson</a> so they'd be ready.  They rappelled down like champs, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12875">Alyssa</a> looked uncannily at <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12876">ease</a>.  We packed up and moved down one level of rock at Playground Point to do our second lead on a 5-4, <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/leavenworth/icicle_creek/106582034">Baby Steps</a>.  I had Alyssa lead belay me this time around and I did the same for her.  This <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12870">route</a> was a bit more run out so even though it was easier, Aaron had us start on the 5-6 since it was better protected.  The three girls practically ran up Baby Steps so it was still fairly early in the afternoon.  Our next objective was some crack climbing, which both Alyssa and Katie had never done. We drove down the road just a little bit to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12869">X-Y Crag</a> area and ran into a couple of other Boealpers - Joe and his daughter Alex.  We put up two ropes and the three girls climbed both <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/leavenworth/icicle_creek/106605330">X</a> and <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/leavenworth/icicle_creek/106605323">Y</a> crack while <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12867">Aaron</a> relaxed.

			We packed up and headed back to camp to get ready for the big cookout.  Originally I was really looking forward to heading to Oktoberfest, but after a day of climbing  and the daunting task of dealing with the details - driving in, paying, crowds - we elected to stay at camp and hang out with the beer we had brought with us.  I still had my skewers in the car which came in very handy.  We cooked some sausage over the open fire, ate, drank, and were merry.  Originally Aaron had talked about doing the multi-ptich R&amp;D route with me the next day, but most of the group was heading to Pearly Gates which Aaron really wanted to climb at, so that became the new game plan.  He didn't get to climb much Saturday and since he'd already done R&amp;D, I thought Pearly Gates would be a good alternative plan.  The rock area is a bit of a hike in and we could actually see the white rock area from Playground Point.  Unfortunately, Aaron had come down with a bad cold and didn't get much sleep Saturday night, so instead of climbing on Sunday we elected to head back to Seattle so that he could hopefully start getting better.  We bid farewell to the crew and headed home.  It was a great weekend - I got my first lead and I got to experience a gorgeous summer day in early October.
