			<h1>Mt Erie 3-14-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			Our Boealps outings have started and for my second outing I woke up at 4:30 AM to head up to Mt Erie near Anacortes.  Our first outing the weekend before was at St Edwards park on the eastside to learn some basic skills such as tying knots, belaying, rappelling, and navigating.  This week at Mt Erie we would be putting those skills to the test high atop the mountain.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10548">Sunrise</a> was amazing when we arrived early in the morning.  Thanks to the time change and our early start, I was able to see the sun rise above the Cascades with colors being cast across Mt Rainier and the Olympics.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10549">view</a> from Mt Erie was amazing, seeing all of those different mountain ranges in addition to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10560">San Juan Islands</a>.  After gearing up and grabbing a rope to carry (those things are heavy!) we started for morning rock.  We got to practice using a prusik on the hike down.  Once at morning rock, I tied in and started my first real <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10557">rappel</a> - I love rappelling.  It was a bit easier since the rock face was closer to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10559">vertical</a> than the 45 degree hill at St Edwards.  We did have a safety second rope tied to us with another student belaying in case someone decided to let go of the rope.  Part of the way down we stopped to do a leg wrap.  You wrap the rope up your thigh three times and that acts as the brake so you can use your hands for other things, like taking pictures.  I got a picture of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10562">Nick</a> doing the 'Look Ma, no hands!' pose.

			After rappelling we did a short rock climb, more for practicing belaying, but it was a good start to my first real rock climbs.  We were supposed to fall a few times on the way up to test the belayer - I had no problems complying with that as I fell normally during my climb.  After a couple of rappels and climbs, we moved over to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10555">afternoon rock</a> for more practice rock climbing and belaying.  My first climb was up route 2 and I got good practice at using cracks.  Near the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10551">top</a> I had to stick my whole forearm into the crack to gain leverage to finish climbing to the top.  It was a lot of fun.  My second attempt didn't end so successfully up <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10553">route 3</a>.  I ran out of gas and just couldn't make it up the last little bit.  I need to learn to use my boots more and thus, my legs.  I try to use my arms too much.  Finally after getting in my required belays, we started back to the trailhead to head home.  Although is was mostly cloudy that day, there was still a great view of the Olympics and San Juan islands as I was sitting on the rock belaying.  As I reached the cars I took one more picture of the amazing view of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10550">Cascades</a>.  On the way back to Seattle we stopped for some food and drinks at the Skagit Brewery.  I even made it back in time to play in 1.5 games of dodgeball - which we won.
