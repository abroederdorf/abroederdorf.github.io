			<h1>Mt Baker Ski Weekend 4/2 - 4/4/10</h1>
			
			<p>
			The weekend plan was to load up a couple of cars and head to the Olympic Peninsula for a weekend of camping.  Emily is heading back east for school so she chose the off weekend for Boealps to get a bunch of her friends together for an adventure.  As the weekend approached the weather reports were very dismal.  Rain all weekend and wind advisories kept popping up.  We were scheduled to meet at 5 to get everything together and get to the ferries Friday evening.  About 3 PM that afternoon the plans started changing, and by 7 PM that night we were headed north to spend the weekend in a cabin and go skiing at <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10738">Mt Baker</a>.  After a few hours in the car we arrived at our new <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10742">red home</a> for the weekend.  The cabin was nice with labels for everything and the most important thing - a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10772">hot tub</a>.  After a few games (they had board games!) we hit the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10771">hot tub</a> before calling it a night.
			</p>
			<p>
			Saturday we woke up at 7 AM to get to the mountain by 9 AM when the lifts were <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10770">starting</a>.  One of the main reasons we went skiing instead of camping was because the mountain was getting <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10764">dumped</a> on.  A few feet fell Friday and almost another foot came down Saturday <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10767">morning</a> while we were skiing.  Most of the group has been skiing/snowboarding for a while and way more advanced than I am, so Yash and I - the beginners - headed for a green <a href="http://www.mtbaker.us/info/trail-map">run</a> off of chair lift <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10769">2</a>.  I believe we ended up coming down the Heather run, although it was hard to tell exactly where to go.  We had never skied in <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10768">powder</a> and it was definitely an experience.  Besides the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10763">powder</a> blanketing everything, it was snowing fairly heavily so visibility was not very good to see where the runs were going.  We finally made it down and decided to go find another green run.  Heather was a little too flat for us.  We went up nearby chair lift 3 and found our <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10760">home</a> for most of the weekend.  We took the green run from up there, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10755">Big Creek</a>.  The run was much better and I was building my confidence, even building my speed every so often.  
			</p>
			<p>
			We were meeting the group back at the lodge at noon for lunch.  Luckily, as we were about to head back we found Shadle because I would never have figured out the way to get back.  We took the Mitzi's green run down to chair lift 2 and then took that over to Home Run to get back to the lodge.  I enjoyed a delicious baked potato with cheese and salsa, some brownie, and stories from the day of skiing.  Yash, Kerry, and I headed back to the top of chair lift <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10759">3</a> for some more afternoon runs.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10754">Kerry's</a> knee was bothering her so she decided to take it easy with us in the afternoon, trying to avoid the powder.  The conditions after lunch had changed quite a bit though.  It stopped snowing so <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10758">visibility</a> improved, and a lot of the powder was gone from everyone skiing through it.  At lunch I also picked up a trail map so <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10752">Yash</a> and I could actually figure out what runs we wanted to try.  That afternoon we discovered Sneaky Pete, a blue run alternative to Big Creek, to get us down to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10762">Cat Walk</a> and back to chair lift 4.  It was a little steeper but nothing we couldn't handle.  After a few more runs we were tired and headed back to the lodge a little early.  We were meeting at 3:30 to head back to the cabin.
			</p>
			<p>
			We stopped in Glacier for a few items and headed back to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10745">cabin</a> to dig into the Easter candy, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10743">birthday cake</a> (Yash's birthday was Monday), and start the lasagna's we got.  We played some Clue, took naps, and ate food.  I was pretty exhausted so I slept on and off and called it an early night, skipping out on the hot tub fun that night.  I was pretty certain that I was just going to hang out in the lodge on Sunday and not go skiing again, so I had packed up most of my stuff.  When I woke up Sunday morning I had a change of heart.  There were a few other people thinking about just getting an afternoon lift ticket but during the drive over and when we pulled into the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10740">parking lot</a>, everyone decided to go.  Saturday it had been snowing and then overcast, but Sunday the sun was out, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10735">blue skies</a> were overhead, and you could see all of the surrounding <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10736">mountains</a> - and what a sight!  It was absolutely gorgeous!  Not only were there breath taking views but thanks to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10725">Easter</a> holiday, there was <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10734">hardly</a> anyone on the slopes too.  We got our lift tickets and headed for the slopes, Yash and I once again heading for some easier runs.  We took a couple warm up runs down from chair lift 3/<a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10732">4</a> - Big Creek and Sneaky Pete.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10731">I</a> almost wanted to stay put on the easy runs so that I could just admire the mountains rather than paying attention to skiing, but we decided to go try some new things.
			</p>
			<p>
			We took chair lift 5 up and found more amazing <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10718">views</a>!  I don't think any view was bad though, just different angles.  Our end goal was runs from the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10722">top</a> of chair lift 8 so we started heading right down the mountain from lift 5.  We eventually made it; I think my run consisted of White Salmon at the top, Easy Money in the middle, and finally the Otto Bahn at the bottom.  We took chair lift 8 up and I just couldn't get over our surroundings.  At the top was a hill a lot of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10720">back country skiers</a> were climbing to find some fresh powder.  I heard one guy call it the stairway to heaven - definitely looked like it.  I slowly made my way down via Daytona.  I should have known from the name, but the run was definitely challenging.  I stopped to take pictures near the top, but then I really had to concentrate on getting down the mountain in one piece, the run was a little steeper than I was expecting.  I made a lot of sweeping turns and was quite tired by time I finally made it down to the bottom, where Yash was waiting.  We took the lift up again, but we strategized to stay left off the lift, hopefully finding some less challenging runs.  By time we got up to the top our lunch plans changed so we decided to start heading back to the lodge.  We kept left down the mountain, trying to get back over to lift 4.  I think I took Oh Zone to Easy Money to White Salmon, and finally to Nose Dive - unfortunately I really did nose dive.  I hit a hard pack from the grooming and was sent flying into some nearby powder.  The snow was caked on the bottom of my boot and in my bindings, so after quite the struggle I finally got my ski back on and made it to the bottom.  Yash had enough time to grab a seat and some water, haha.  We went up chair lift 4 and took our usual route back to the lodge via Mitzi's run, lift 2, and Home Run.  
			</p>
			<p>
			There was a little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10726">deck</a> that wrapped around part of the lodge so we enjoyed our <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10727">lunch</a> out there with an incredible view of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10723">Mt Shuksan</a>.  After lunch Yash and I decided to take it easy in the afternoon and went back up lift 3 to do the Big Creek and Sneaky Pete runs.  I mostly stuck to blue Sneaky Pete to try and work on my turns.  By the time I went back to the lodge to meet up with everyone, my knees hurt and I was ready for a 3 hour car ride back to Seattle.  After checking the Seattle forecast and finding rain, we decided to forgo cooking brats back at the guys' house and stopped in Bellingham for some dinner.  I had some delicious smoked salmon chowder.  Once back in Seattle, Shadle fired up their wood burning stove and we finally made some s'mores in the comfort of a dry living room.  They were delicious.  I don't think anyone was disappointed in how the weekend turned out by missing some wet, cold, windy, sandy camping in the Olympics.  Mt Baker was a great end to my ski season and the weekend was a blast with everyone!
