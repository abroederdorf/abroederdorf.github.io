			<h1>Red Rock Canyon 1-1-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			What better way to start the new year than to go hiking?  Cory had suggested going on New Year's Eve but I wasn't sure if I would be strong enough (I had a stomach bug hit me the day before and hadn't really been eating since) and it was a little later in the day so we'd probably be short on daylight, so we opted to see Avatar in 3D that day, a good movie.  Feeling better on Jan 1, I decided hiking sounded like a good idea.  We went to <a href="http://www.redrockcanyonlv.org/">Red Rock Canyon</a>, a <a href="http://www.blm.gov/nv/st/en/fo/lvfo/blm_programs/blm_special_areas/red_rock_nca.html">national conservation area</a> just a few miles outside of Las Vegas. We all piled into the van and started the 30 min drive to the park.  It's a great park that is easily accessible and really close to Las Vegas, it was really nice.  I like having nature so accessible from cities, the contrast is intriguing.

			There were plenty of cars at the park already; I guess everyone was trying to make good on their New Years resolutions of being more active or getting outdoors more.  We only had a couple hours before the park closed so we decided on the <a href="http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/projects/geoweb/participants/Dutch/VTrips/RedRx2005.HTM">Keystone Thrust</a> hike, a moderate 2.2 mile hike with an elevation gain of 400'.  Part of the park is the 13 mile scenic drive which we followed to the trailhead about 6 miles in.  As we drove, we saw several groups hiking on the 19 trails in the park and several groups rock climbing.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10019">desert</a> environment is so different from my usual hiking areas in the Cascades and Olympics.  I think the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10017">bare rocks</a> are pretty, especially because of the colors like the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9994">red</a>.
			</p>

			We had about a half mile drive on a gravel road off of the main drive and it was a bumpy one.  And I thought the forest service roads were bad!  It was just a lot of loose gravel with some large stones thrown in on a pretty uneven surface.  The small trailhead was pretty full but we managed to find a spot.  I started the GPS, Cory took a picture of the board with the trail directions, and we set off.  We met quite a few groups going up but none on the way back down, which would make sense since it was close to the closing time.  The trail was pretty well defined during the first half mile or so, there was a clear <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9999">sign</a> pointing to the fork to take.  This part of the trail also had a lot of loose gravel though, not one of my favorite surfaces to hike on.  We reached some large sections of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10003">sandstone</a> and found an interesting little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10004">dwelling</a> made of rocks. I think hikers had a little too much fun, haha.  There were some interesting <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10011">desert</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10013">plants</a> and I was actually surprised at the variety in the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9995">mountains</a> around us.
			</p>
			<p>
			The trail started getting harder to follow as it crossed the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10012">rocky terrain</a> so just shy of a mile we stopped for a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10006">group</a> picture and decided to head back to the trailhead.  The trail was supposed to be 1.1 miles so we were close to the 'end'.  On the way back we paused for some snow fun, namely Cory and Katie making <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10001">snowballs</a> to throw at the rest of us.  The hike back was easy going as it was mostly down hill.  At the trailhead we discovered the ultimate adventure <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9998">vehicle</a>. It was a fun hike and a great way to start 2010!

			As with the new year there are new changes and one big one that I'm not sure if I'm happy with is the web site I use to analyze my GPS data. I used MotionBased but everything has transitioned to Garmin Connect which has slightly different controls.  I don't feel like it's as extensive but maybe over time they'll add capability.  Something is better than nothing though, but my plots will be different and I won't have as detailed stats on my hikes anymore.
