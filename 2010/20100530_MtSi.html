			<h1>Mt Si 5/30/10</h1>
			
			<p>
			Memorial Day this year has been a little different from a year ago in terms of weather, clouds and cooler temperatures this year.  I hiked up <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-si">Mt Si</a> for the first time last Memorial Day weekend and I did it for the third time this year.  Aaron was planning on hiking up for the first time ever for some training and I tagged along to break in my new boots.  I was already thinking about going up to see if I had improved from my hike up in February before Boealps.  We left Seattle at a leisurely 9:15 AM to head to the trailhead.  There were plenty of cars when we got there.  One positive of the weather is that it kept crowds down because it was at a normal level of busy compared to a holiday level.  The trail was pretty muddy in spots, to be expected with our recent wet weather though.</span><br>
			<br>
			Aaron started out at his fast pace and burned me out in the first half mile or so, so the rest of the hike up was at my amazingly slow pace.  Just after a mile and a half my heels were really starting to bother me so Aaron gave me some of his bright green duct tape to cover the blisters starting to form on them.  If they got a lot worse we'd turn around but I was a trooper and continued at my slow pace the rest of the way up. (My right heel has about 4 and the ones on my left I think popped during hikng, yay for wrecking my feet)  We reached the top at an hour and 59 minutes, only a few minutes faster than my last attempt.  I'm  not sure how heavy my pack had been the first time up but I don't think it was the 20 lbs I carried this time.  I had brought my rock climbing gear in case we decided exit 38 was dry enough, and carabiners weigh a lot.  For my first time ever though, I did a fairly substantial hike without stopping for breaks, I just did my steady slow pace.  That in itself was a small victory.  The past two times I had hiked up Mt Si I just found a lunch spot among the rocks at the top, to enjoy the sunshine and views.  This time we continued passed those onto the trail that led us to the Haystack.</span><br>
			<br>
			After a quick break for water and to let me catch my breath, we started the scramble up <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11221">Haystack</a>.  There were numerous signs warning potential climbers about the hazards, but the scramble was very doable.  I would probably advise against doing it if a person is not comfortable/hasn't done a lot of scrambling or climbing before.  We made it to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11220">top</a>, signed the log <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11216">book</a> and took in the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11214">cloudy view</a>.  Instead of the normal clear view of Mt Rainier, Seattle, and the Olympics we could only see <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11217">North Bend</a> down below.  We also found a little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11222">gnome</a> up there that had been left by previous hikers who had summited the Haystack.  After Aaron enjoyed some of his summit <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11215">pixie stick</a>, we started the descent.  Going down is always more tricky.  I wish my legs were just a few inches longer, it would make it a lot easier, but I made it down fine.  The hike down went by quickly, it's always nice to have the help of gravity.  </span><br>
			<br>
			After changing into some drier and less smelly clothing, we headed back to Seattle to go climbing at the gym, <a href="http://www.verticalworld.com/content/view/14/26/">Vertical World</a>.  Since it was my first time and I was going with a member, I got to climb for free - always a nice bonus.  After taking and passing my belay test, we started climbing.  I started with a 5-6 and mostly stuck to 5-7's.  I tried a 5-8 and failed pretty miserably - my excuse was being tired from hiking.  Half of the battle for me is still figuring out what holds are allowed for the different routes, Aaron was definitely helping guide me from below.  It was a lot of fun and I'll definitely continue my climbing education this summer.  I was making it up the walls but I'm sure in not such a pretty fashion.  It is kind of fun starting out though because I don't know what my limits are so I try lots of things.  It was also the first time I got to use my sport harness which was a lot nicer than my alpine bod, much more comfortable when hanging.  I also learned how to use a grigri for the first time.  It was a little awkward at first, but it's a lot nicer than supporting the climber off of myself during a take or going for a ride when he/she falls.  During my belay test the guy said I did everything safely, but it's different than what they teach in the gym.  I guess that's what you get when I learned everything in a mountaineering class :-).
