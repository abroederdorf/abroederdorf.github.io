			<h1>Wenatchee 6/5/10</h1>
			
			<p>
			This weekend's adventure was in Leavenworth, a great area tucked away in the mountains.  Our main goal was to do some rafting on the Wenatchee with BEWET, but I figured as long as we had gone all that way why not go hiking?  And better yet, some friends suggested rock climbing so the weekend was shaping up to be pretty great.  Alyssa, Danielle, and I packed up Vinni and hit the road about 6PM from the Seattle area.  After a quick pit stop in North Bend for some food (both for us and Vinni) we continued along I-90 eastward.  The weather wasn't great and the mountains were mostly shrouded in clouds, but it's still always nice to drive through the mountains. We got to Leavenworth right around 9PM and set up our tents via headlamp as the sun had just dipped below the nearby mountains.  After setting up our tents, we enjoyed some fun around the campfire under the stars before calling it a night.

			We woke up at a leisurely 7:15AM Saturday morning and picked up some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11234">farmer jane</a> wet suits from nearby <a href="http://www.shoottherapids.com/rental.html">Osprey</a> before heading back to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11258">campsite</a> to get ready for a fun filled day of rafting.  The sun was out and it looked like it might just turn into an amazing day.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11253">Natalie</a> was our guide and we had James and Todd as boat mates.  We camped at a private site along Icicle Creek and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11257">put in</a> there as well.  The sun was very welcome, especially when getting wet.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icicle_Creek">Icicle Creek</a> lives up to its name.  The creek provides a nice, slow area to get reacquainted (or learn) the rafting commands before joining the Wenatchee River.  The river is pretty slow before the weir (aka lunch), but there is pretty <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11236">scenery</a> to enjoy while casually floating along.  We did enter some more '<a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11250">fun</a>' water but the only rapid set we went through before lunch was <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11246">Rock 'N Roll</a> with the infamous Satan's Eyeball rapid. It proved a great opponent this trip as it tossed the back of our boat. Our guide luckily just ended up near the front of the boat - but in it still. <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11245">Alyssa</a> got popped out into the river and I finally noticed her in the front of the boat. She was able to go along the side of the boat and hang on to the chicken line near the back until we were out of the rapids and our guide could pull her in.  She was amazingly calm for going swimming and for her excellent swimming adventure, she was awarded the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11244">water wings</a> at lunch time.

			After lunch the excitement picked up as we went through several sets of rapids.  Our crowning achievement in the afternoon was making it into the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/7216">cave</a>.  I've tried every time down the river and on my third trip I finally made it in.  There was a sickly <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11242">duck</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11240">inside</a> to greet us and we scared out a few birds.  We were the only team that made it and we were plenty proud of our accomplishment.  Once outside the cave we were hit by a swarm of bugs.  At first we noticed them <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11239">on each other</a> and then all over the boat - we thought we had picked them up in the cave.  As we continued and we were pelted in the face by bugs, we soon realized they were swarming up the river.  They were everywhere and you couldn't kill them fast enough.  I think going through our last rapid set we finally drowned them, but what a nuisance!  We made it through some great sets of rapids in the afternoon, getting <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11237">drenched</a> but at least keeping everyone inside the boat.  We finally got to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11235">takeout</a> in Cashmere and started getting the boats ready to go back on the truck - drying, deflating, rolling.  There were even a few paragliders that landed in a nearby field.

			After returning the wet suits we went back to camp to change for our second outing of the day - some rock climbing along Icicle Creek Rd.  We had two full cars head out - Danielle, Alyssa, Aaron N, Aaron P, Niki, Nate, and Tracy.  The crew was really awesome about helping teach us so I observed the Aarons lead climb/belay; both Alyssa and Danielle got their first official rock climbs in; and Aaron taught me how to clean the route at the end - I even got a rappel.  The rock in Leavenworth is definitely slabby, but since most of my climbing has been there I don't know much else!  After climbing we went back to the campsite for the potluck and our awesome friends fed us well.  After feasting we enjoyed the campfire festivities, including a s'mores assembly line, before finally calling it a night.  We even had a good human rotisserie line going to keep ourselves warm around the fire.

			Sunday we woke up to rain and decided to forgo the hike to Colchuck Lake.  I've been wanting to do the hike so it will remain on my list.  Although now I have even more incentive since I can pair it with some rock climbing which is always a lot of fun.  Instead we packed up, said goodbye to the rest of the crew who was rafting another day, and went into Leavenworth for a quick mini breakfast stop before heading back to Seattle via Highway 2.  It was a great weekend and Saturday seemed like an awesome start to summer.  Now we just need a few more days like Saturday and summer will be off to a great start and filled with adventures!
