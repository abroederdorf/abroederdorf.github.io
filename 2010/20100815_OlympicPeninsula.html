			<h1>Olympic Peninsula 8.14.10 - 8.15.10</h1>
			
			<p>
			Emily was back in town so we thought it was a great opportunity to try and get out to the Olympic Peninsular finally.  We had tried going in April but it was forecasted to be rainy all weekend while Baker was getting dumped on, so we opted for an awesome weekend of skiing instead.  We pared off, loaded up the cars, and were leaving at various times to get over to the peninsula.  After a call from Emily telling me that Niki and Sam were still waiting after 2 hours to get across at Edmonds, Yash and I opted to try the ferry from <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12630">Seattle</a> to Bainbridge.  After more than an hour of creeping up the street, with a good majority of that not moving at all, we finally got into the loading area, only to wait about another hour.  Luckily we were able to grab some food and stand around to stretch our legs though.  After 3 hours of waiting, we finally were off on the 5:30 <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12628">ferry</a> - we left at 6:20.  Luckily the ferry was really only the negative aspect of the entire trip.  We were the last to arrive so on our drive from Bainbridge to Port Angeles, Yash got a call from Steve saying there were no more campsites at Heart of the Hills, our intended home for the night, so instead they got a hotel room. The hotel room was gigantic.  We fit Niki's large tent inside inbetween the beds and couch, with some room to spare.  We went down the street to the pub before heading back to camp out in our hotel room, ready for a weekend of fun.
			</p>

			After grabbing some complimentary breakfast, Emily and I stopped at the ranger station to get some bear canisters and wilderness permits for camping at Second Beach that night.  The bear canisters are actually for the raccoons that frequent the beach.  After the quick stop at the ranger station we were on the road, heading up to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12626">Hurricane Ridge</a>.  We went for a quick walk up a nearby <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12625">knoll</a> and then spotted Steve's car so we went down to meet up with him and Yash, who had woken up early for the sunrise.  The ranger thought it'd be really busy at Second Beach so we cut out trip at Hurricane Ridge short to ensure we'd get a stellar camping spot, and we did.  We set up <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12560">camp</a> at the end of the beach near some big rocks, so it created a semi-private area for us, complete with bathroom knook.  There were several people that would still walk down the beach to us, but relatively speaking, it was pretty quiet.  After setting up camp we hiked back out to head into Forks to get lunch and food for that night.
			</p>
			<p>
			When we finally got back to our campsite we settled in for the night.  There was <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12617">swimming</a> and relaxing in the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12612">sun</a> reading a book.  Too bad I left my book at home, and a towel for that matter.  I did manage to nap on a rock for a little while, and woke up to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12611">batting</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12610">practice</a>.  I had brought out my big 16" <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12608">softball</a> and my old bat so we had a backyard (or ocean side?) <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12607">softball</a> game, 4-on-4.  Hitting into the ocean counted as a ground rule double and we had put frisbees out for our bases.  We got a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12606">innings</a> in and I think everyone had a good time.  It was definitely fun to hit the ball and run around a bit.  It was getting to about dinner time so we decided to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12605">help</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12604">Steve</a> gather some fire wood for cooking. I had brought out my little hatchet which I think proved pretty helpful. Steve got the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12601">fire</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12600">roaring</a> and we started cooking some sausage.  Just about this time was also <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12597">low tide</a>, so we ventured out to the tide pools which are always a lot of fun.  The sun was starting to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12591">set</a> too, so we had some beautiful <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12582">scenery</a> for our dinner.  Sam and I walked out to explore the tide pools, finding some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12595">anemones</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12584">star fish</a>, and barnacle and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12588">mussle</a> covered rocks. In our flip flops, we were able to climb up on the rocks, just in time to see the last <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12587">sliver</a> of the sun drop below the horizon.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12583">moon</a> was up and we were bathed in some awesome light from the setting sun, the scene was absolutely breath taking.  As the night wore on, we had fun playing on the beach in the moon light.  Steve got an amazing <a href="http://washingtonlivin.blogspot.com/2010/08/olympic-peninsula-mountains-forests.html">pictures</a> as Emily, Sam, Niki, and I danced with our headlamps - it only took us about 30 minutes to get it right, haha.  After that was time for <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12578">s'mores</a>, before the girls all grabbed our sleeping pads to lay out under the stars and catch more shooting stars from the Perseid meteor shower.  It was so nice that we decided to sleep out on the beach under the stars.  It got a little damp but we refused to give in and join the guys in the tent.  Sam even woke up to high tide just a couple feet from our own feet - nothing like cutting it close!
			</p>
			<p>
			In the morning the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12576">clouds</a> had rolled in and our picturesque beach from the day before was gone.  Amazingly we <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12575">slept</a> in until 10am, I don't think I've ever slept that late while camping.  We <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12574">packed</a> up, grabbed a few pop tarts for breakfast, and headed for the car.  Our next stop was the Hoh Rain Forest for a dip in the river.  We had to go through Forks again so we dropped off the bear canisters before heading down the road to the visitor center.  Along the way we were frustrated by extremely slow drivers, stopped to hug a giant tree, and even spotted an <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12572">elk</a>.  We grabbed some snacks and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12571">took</a> off for a couple miles through the rain forest until I complained and we stopped at the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12568">river</a>.  The water was nice and cool and refreshing.  Emily and Steve were the daring ones that actually went for a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12564">swim</a>, the rest of us just <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12562">dipped</a> our feet in for the most part.  After enjoying some calm, we hiked back out to finally head back to Seattle.  We rendezvoused in Port Angeles for some fish for dinner, and then headed for the ferry.  Vinni did pretty well, passing a few cars along the way even.  It was no fee weekend in the national parks, coupled with the really nice weather, meant there were tons of people on the road.  Unfortunately we missed the ferry by 9 cars, the others made it though.  Eventually we made it back to my sauna of an apartment - we were so lucky to be in cooler weather on the coast all weekend - and enjoyed some nice, warm showers.  It was an amazing weekend hanging out with good friends and enjoying nature at her finest.
