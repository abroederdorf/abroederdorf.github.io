			<h1>Big Chief 3-21-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			I consider our third Boealps outing the first real one, although we of course were still learning lots of new skills.  This Sunday I woke up at 4:00AM to meet some of my team at the park and ride before heading for Stevens Pass.  After making a quick pit stop we were at the pass and gearing up – in the rain.  Well, I guess it was going to be a good test of my gear in the weather of the northwest.  Before starting up Big Chief from the parking lot, we talked about walking with our ice ax and kick stepping.  Using the self arrest hold, we hiked up the mountain always making sure to put the ax on our uphill side.  If we were to slip, the intent is for the ice ax to stop you from going anywhere.  Kick stepping was kind of fun.  We hiked in a line, with the first person kick stepping.  After the first few people improve the steps, a nice ‘stair case' is created for the rest of the team to hike up.  After 30 or so steps, the front person would step out of line and let the group pass.  During this break I'd grab some food and water (as recommended).  We also would thank the person for their steps so it was a great opportunity to learn the names of my new teammates and instructors.  Luckily half way up the mountain the rain turned into snow.  The sun did try to peak out a few times during the day but there was definitely no view to be had thanks to all of the clouds.  Quickly into the hike I fell in love with my new <a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com/site/meteor_mitts_mil.html">Meteor</a> mittens from Outdoor Research.  The fleece mitten liners have removeable fingers that stay in place with magnets.  They were so convenient for doing things throughout the day and they kept my hands nice and warm!

			After a couple hours we made it to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10585">ridge</a>, our destination for most of the day.  At the ridge we learned lots of new skills including self arrest with an ice ax, creating snow anchors, and belyaing.  We started with learning to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10582">self arrest</a> and it was a lot of fun.  The scariest position was being on my back with my head downhill.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10583">chutes</a> we were using were pretty well packed by that time and I took off down the mountain before I had time to think - I definitely needed to self arrest.  I got the hang of it pretty well, although I still need to put more weight in my shoulders over the pick. I managed to always stop myself and I didn't impale myself on my ax, so I guess you can call that a success.

			Next we learned to travel in rope teams as we hiked the rest of the way to the summit.  I was the lead of my team on the way to the summit so I got to practice setting a reasonable pace for the team – which was pretty easy since I'm a relatively slow hiker.  If one member falls the rest of the team drops into the self arrest position, so we got to practice that a few times thanks to our instructors.  At the summit we took a couple of pictures and enjoyed some chocolate thanks to our lead instructor Rich.  The students are supposed to bring summit treats to share – I guess I'll have to work on that for next week.

			We hiked back to our spot on the ridge to learn about setting snow anchors next, using pickets and a deadman.  Aaron and I did a pretty good job, or we weren't able to pull our anchors out at least.  Next we learned some quick belaying techniques using our ice ax, boot, and a carabiner. Finally it was time to head back down the mountain so we learned plunge stepping.  I'm a pretty slow plunge stepper, although it really didn't help being at the back of the group with all the fresh snow being trampled already – in my opinion at least.  We made it back down in about an hour and it was onto Mexican food for dinner at Ixtapo in Sultan.  I made it back to Seattle just in time to play in almost the whole first dodgeball game, and then help my team win the second one.  Next week is the last night of the season for playoffs so hopefully I'll make it back in time but we'll see.
