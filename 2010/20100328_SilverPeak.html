			<h1>Silver Peak 3-28-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			The fourth Boealps outing was to the Snoqualmie Pass area.  Team 6 aka Blue Steel aka Team Awesome, was heading to Silver Peak specifically.  I woke up at 4:15 AM to finish getting my food together (including summit treats) and getting ready for the day.  The previous week I had forgotten both my map and sunglasses, so I was trying to do better.  After getting stuff together I sat down on the couch with my bowl of Active cereal (it's just like Special K) and turned on the TV.  I don't think I need to say it, but there's not much on TV at 4:30 AM on Sunday.  If that wasn't bad enough, it's entirely too early for me to be eating breakfast.  I'm not a person that's hungry when I wake up, it usually takes me a couple hours – but for hiking/climbing, I know I need my energy so I try to eat something.  As I was scrolling through the channel guide I came across the Little Mermaid cartoon on the Disney Channel.  Yes! I thought this day was shaping into something good.  Now don't get me wrong, the cartoon doesn't hold a candle to the actual movie, but it's fine company for a lowly bowl of cereal at 4:30 AM on a Sunday morning.

			As soon as I left my apartment I was walking into the rain.  Great - hiking in the rain - my favorite.  I didn't really expect anything different given the dismal weather reports I had looked up, but I was really hoping this would be one of those days the weatherman got it all wrong.  I got to the park and ride to meet up with some teammates by 5:15 AM so we could carpool to the Annette Lake trailhead, our starting point for the outing.  This week's focus was on having the students navigate and pick a route.  After gearing up, we left from the trailhead a little late – 7:20 AM.  I started by leading the group (I figured I should navigate during the easy part when we were just following a well established trail).  Along the trail we would stop to identify where we were at on our maps – we looked for different things like transmission lines, footbridges, switchbacks, and elevation.  I had my shell on to protect myself from the rain, but it was rather warm so I soon started overheating and shedding layers – hat, mittens, extra shirt.  Finally we encountered some snow on the trail and eventually came across some prime <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10715">avalanche chutes</a>.  To cross the chutes, one person <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10714">watches</a> uphill for an avalanche, one person watches the climber crossing - in case they do get caught in an avalanche, we know where to start looking - and the climber crosses alone.  We finally got to some more level ground, the spot we had chosen to veer off trail and start our ascent up the mountain.
			</p>
			<p>
			The first little bit was through a tree area along the trail.  We emerged from the trees to find ourselves at the base of a wide open <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10712">snow field</a> - not good.  One of the things we look for to indicate avalanche danger is debris on the hillside from previous avalanches, like snowballs.  There were plenty of snowballs to be found.  We quickly made a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10709">bee line</a> for a nearby group of trees to try and seek some sort of protection, although trees are no guarantee.  Once we reached the trees we continued our ascent up the hill, staying close to the sparsely spaced trees.  I do have to admit I much prefer hiking up the side of the mountain in snow over hiking along a muddy trail - at least when I'm with a big team and we all take turns <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10705">kick-stepping</a>.  After kick-stepping for a little bit (generally 30ish steps, unless you are very ambitious) you step out of line to rest and grab some food and water.  I also used those opportunities to take some pictures of our <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10679">surroundings</a>.  The weather was dismal throughout much of our hike along the trail, raining almost the entire time.  Once we got on the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10706">mountainside</a> things started to improve, much to my delight, and some sun even poked through.  We got a few glimpses of blue skies and the surrounding mountains.  We even saw <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10697">Annette Lake</a> down below us, our only view since we never finished following the trail to the lake.
			</p>
			<p>
			The snow got pretty deep in some places so kick-stepping became a great workout.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10699">Sergey</a> was charging up the mountain with me in tow as the second person.  The second and third people are also working hard trying to improve the steps so I had to take a break before I actually kicked any steps myself!  Finally we reached the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10683">ridgeline</a>.  I was close to the front and started the last ascent up a very icy slope, it was hard to create very large steps.  This actually isn't a problem as you only need a small step for your toes, but for my nerves it was probably the most uncomfortable part of the trip.  I just didn't feel like I had a solid stance on the mountain as I waited for Nate to check for cornices.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10685">Cornices</a> can be deadly when people walk out onto them without realizing it, and they give way.  Nate spotted some cornices but saw another, safer <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10690">route</a> to another place along the ridge.  Unfortunately I had to backtrack down the small section of icy slope.  It was hard to plunge step but thankfully I had my ice ax, my safety net - it definitely gave me some confidence.  I got back to the groups' tracks and over to our 'summit' <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10688">spot</a>.  The instructors set up a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10687">static line</a> so we could harness up and practice using it as we ascended our mini summit.  The true summit was still a distance away, but I felt very accomplished by where we climbed to - definitely a successful climb in my eyes.  After everyone had a chance to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10681">prusik</a> up the static line, we packed up to head back.  As we were packing up we also enjoyed numerous summit treats.  The instructors did a good job of guilting all the students the week before for not bringing any summit treats for Big Chief, so I think we had 3 or 4 treats for Silver Peak.  I made my new favorite - peanut butter bars.  They didn't look the prettiest but they still tasted good.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10682">weather</a> had turned nasty by this point with a biting wind and some hail.  As we descended a little ways we got back into a light snow luckily.
			</p>
			<p>
			We started by plunge stepping and I was enjoying it a lot more with so much fresh snow, at least compared to last weekend.  After reaching one point our lead instructor, Rich, decided to let us glissade.  We had not learned about it yet and the conditions were not quite ideal - no large run out, or open area, in case we got out of control and couldn't self arrest.  The snow was great though so he taught us.  It is so much fun, definitely my favorite part!  We glissaded by sitting down, you can also stand and I think kneel?  We used our ice ax to stay at a reasonable speed by keeping the spike plunged down into the snow and gripping the head - ready for self arrest.  I was able to easily keep up with the team by glissading down, we made such good time!  We made it back to the tree line and then to the trail, once again in the rain, to head back to the car.  The trail was muddy, and wet, and seemed like an eternity when a car is waiting to whisk you back to society - or more importantly a good meal and dry clothes.  Overall it was a great outing, but I can't wait for nice weather and the views we'll have!
