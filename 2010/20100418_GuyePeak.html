			<h1>Guye Peak 4-18-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			The sixth outing for Boealps was back in the Snoqualmie Pass area climbing Guye Peak.  This was labeled our ‘experience climb’ but we also continued to work on our navigation skills.  I always like hiking in the Snoqualmie Pass area because that means I get to sleep in a little more since it’s close to Seattle.  We loaded up the cars at the park and ride at 5:30 AM and hit the road.  I caught a few more zzz’s and woke up just in time to us exiting I-90 to the parking lot at the Snoqualmie West ski area.  It had been very foggy in Seattle but it was relatively clear in the mountains.  We could see <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10971">Guye Peak</a> from the parking lot, now we just needed to find our way to the top.  After gearing up, including applying the all important sunscreen, we headed down the road.
			</p>
			<p>
			The instructors were having fun second guessing our navigation decisions, trying to fake us out.  We found our way to the trailhead by the campground, the board mostly buried.  There were several tracks so we started following those up the valley.  We could hear the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10968">stream</a> and saw it on our maps.  Soon we came to it and an area that had been used to cross it, but Rich decided to forge ahead and try to find some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10967">snow bridges</a> instead of tromping through the water.  We continued on a ways and encountered several snow bridges that we crossed one at a time.  Finally we were on the Guye Peak side of the streams and it was time to head out of the valley and up to the saddle. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We followed <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10963">tracks</a> for most of the climb which was good and bad.  Good because we didn’t have to expend energy making steps but bad because they were really large.  I’m sure most of the team didn’t mind, but being the shorter person that I am, I had a hard time with the big steps and was exerting a lot more energy than I would have liked.  I stepped out to take a quick break and Rich decided to take a group break so I grabbed some more food and water.  It’s amazing what impact feeling good has on a climb, I was eating more and much more energetic.  We finally made it to the saddle.  The instructors took off ahead of us to start setting up the ropes we needed to make all three summits, while the students along with Rich and Jim continued to the base of the first summit, the north peak.  We shed our packs there and only grabbed the essentials – harness and climbing gear, ice axes, and food. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We finished the short trek up to the first <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10962">summit</a> and were rewarded with spectacular views of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10932">mountains</a> all around us.  The summit wasn’t very big so Rich rigged up a line tying slings together for us to anchor into.  You could see <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10958">Alpental</a>, another ski area, below us.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10959">Mt Rainier</a> was out in the distance as well as many more surrounding mountains, all snow capped and beautiful.  We took a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10957">pictures</a> and grabbed a little food, but before long the instructors had finished setting up the ropes and were ready for us to continue on to the other summits.
			</p>
			<p>
			After a quick stop back at my pack to grab my summit treats (gummy bears) I <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10954">rappelled</a> down and then anchored into the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10952">line</a> with a prusik and personal anchor to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10931">climb</a> up to summit two, the middle peak.  I continued right past this summit and continued to prusik along the rope to the third and final summit, the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10950">south peak</a>.  This <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10947">summit</a> had a lot more room for us to gather as a team.  The instructors had fun flying Nate’s little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10949">kite</a> while they waited for us to summit.  Delicious summit <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10944">treats</a> were passed around – including chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate covered bacon, and pickles – and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10941">photo</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10942">shoots</a> commenced.  The view was so amazing everyone had to get a picture or two with Mt Rainier.  You could even make out a small, hazy Mt Adams in the distance but it didn’t show up very well in pictures. I had brought my gorilla pod so I set that up on my ice ax to get a couple of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10940">group</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10939">summit</a> pictures. 
			</p>
			<p>
			It was time to head back to the cars.  The warm, afternoon sun had made the snow quite slushy so we were cautious crossing back to our base camp near the first summit.  We packed up, I got a rope to carry, and we started our glissades down to the saddle.  I don’t know if it was the extra weight or snow conditions, but I felt a lot more out of control on my glissades and self-arrested a couple of times.  We made our way down from the saddle through the trees, with a few short glissades thrown in.  We finally got to the stream and continued up it until we got to the crossing we had decided to pass that morning.  The crossing required you to traipse through the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10936">water</a> so I was happy we were doing it on our way back to the cars rather than in the morning.  Note to self, bring an extra pair of socks in the future.  We each took our turn <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10937">climbing</a> down the snow to the stream and running across.  I unfortunately missed the tree at the bottom of the snow bank and splashed into the water, so I ran across with wet feet.  Others were more careful and avoided wet feet.  Nate was the last one to cross and got in a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10934">snowball</a> fight with the whole team while he was down there – talk about a sitting duck. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Another mile and we found ourselves back at the cars.  I had brought clothes to change into this time and was really excited about it, especially fresh socks.  We were planning on stopping at the Issaquah Brewery but the wait was an hour, so we found our way over to nearby Stan’s BBQ, an excellent choice.  I had some brisket and it was amazing – not sure if that’s due to the food itself or the fact it was my reward after a long day of hiking.  Either way it was good and a great end to an amazing day.
