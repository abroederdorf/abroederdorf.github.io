			<h1>Whistler Weekend 11.25 - 11.28.10</h1>
			
			<p>
			The 2010-2011 winter is a La Nina year (lots of snow), so when  Thanksgiving rolled around it was time to start my ski season.  A bunch  of friends were heading up to Whistler in British Columbia for the  weekend and invited me along.  They had a condo rented not far from the  Village.  I had been to Whistler once my first year in Seattle, but it  was before ski season so we just walked around the village and I enjoyed  all the mountain views on the drive to/from Whistler.  After  Thanksgiving dinner, everyone hit the road for the 4-5 hour drive up to  Whistler.  We got a bunch of snow in Seattle earlier in the week and  there was still plenty of snow along the road.  Luckily the mountain  areas know how to deal with it so it wasn't a big deal.

			Friday morning we were up early so we could get on the gondolas as  soon as they started running.  The mid mountain was open so we took the  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13051">gondolas</a> up Blackcomb to start, a nice ride and a new experience for  me.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13078">Aaron N</a> was trying out his telemark ski gear for the first time, so  I followed him down a bunch of blue runs.  Whistler was definitely a  new experience for me.  The runs were significantly longer than I had  skied before and the snow made for some interesting conditions - I found  a lot more bumps than I would have liked.  We met at the mid-mountain  lodge for lunch and then took the peak-to-peak gondola over to Whistler  for the afternoon.  It was snowing pretty well and most of the guys had  snow hair or frozen <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13077">beards</a>.  I followed the group down a few more runs,  although got in a little over my head when we unexpectedly found a mogul  field.  That's just a bit out of my comfort zone since I'm not an  expert skier yet and enjoy having more open runs so I can traverse at my  leisure before making turns.  I made it through though and took a break  from the next run.  The tongue was all messed up in my right boot and  was hurting my leg so I welcomed the break.  It was easy to spot the  group with all of their bright <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13048">colors</a> riding back up the chair lift.   About 3PM the group started down the mountain for the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13059">village</a>.  I  followed them down most of it, but down loaded on the gondola while the  rest of them skied all the way down.  When I finally got down at met  them at the Longhorn, they said it was a good choice for me.

			Friday was Bobby's birthday so after a few pitchers at the Longhorn,  we went back to our lodge for some hot tub time.  First, in our long  underwear and me in my down booties, Aaron N and I made a run to the  grocery store to pick up some food for dinner.  The hut tub felt amazing  after a long day of skiing and it was nice and warm.  I loved sitting  outside in the hot tub as it snowed on us.  After some spaghetti dinner and more <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13075">shenanigans</a>, we headed <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13071">out</a> to continue celebrating at Buffalo  Bills.  After some confusion with coat check several hours later, we  were on our way back to the lodge - scurrying past a small bear that had  found it's way down some stairs in the village.

			After a long day on my leg (my hip flexor was still bothering me), I  took Saturday off from skiing and got a nap and some reading in  instead.  I did take a quick shopping excursion with Niki when her snowboarding boots broke, so I learned a lot about those. Saturday night was a little quieter with some hot tub time followed by lots of nap time.  Sunday morning we were up early to pack up and check out before hitting the slopes for our last day of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13056">skiing</a>.  We started on <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13039">Whistler</a> and I decided to break off on my own and stick to the green  runs so that I felt comfortable and didn't limit/slow down the rest of  the group.  We met up for lunch and decided to ride on the peak-to-peak  gondola, specifically waiting for one of the two <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13052">glass</a> bottom cars.  It  was a nice afternoon break and we got some great <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13050">views</a> since Sunday was fairly <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13038">clear</a> and sunny.  After that I got a few more green runs in on my  own.  Once a little kid took me out, I decided I had skied enough and  headed back down the mountain to meet everyone at the Long Horn to head  home.  It was a really fun weekend at Whistler and a great start to my  ski season.  Whistler is a great ski area and I can't wait to go back in  the future and see how much I've improved.</p>
