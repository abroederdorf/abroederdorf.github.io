			<h1>Mt Washington 5-8-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			I was going to be lazy on Saturday and rest (something I don't get to do a lot these days) but the weather was just too nice to stay indoors so I found my way into the mountains. The forecast for Seattle was sunshine and 60's but there was a possibility of a storm rolling in after 11:00AM in the mountains, so Carla and I left at 8:00AM for Mt Washington. Since I wanted to be lazy, I was trying to find a relatively easy hike (&lt; 5 miles) along I-90 somewhere. After scouring the hikes on Washington Trails Association, I decided on Mt Washington. It was to be 4 miles round trip with an elevation gain of 1600'. I picked Carla up and we headed down I-90 to exit 38.  
			</p>
			<p>
			It was pretty clear with just a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11030">clouds</a> dotting the sky so I was hoping the weather would hold out. We parked at the trailhead in Olallie state park, the first drive off of the exit. After putting my old, worn out boots on we hit the trail. We were at a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11039%22">junction</a> almost immediately so after consulting my guide book, we turned left. After hiking for a while along a nice wide, shallow trail we thought we probably took a wrong turn and headed back. We passed our initial junction and started looking for the trail. We saw some powerlines and what kind of looked like a trail through a wooded section. We went exploring and although there really wasn't a trail, there looked like there might be one along a ridgeline further in. Good thing we continued exploring because we found ourselves on a trail.
			</p>
			<p>
			We started heading up, and although there were no signs, from the description in my book we thought we were probably <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11036">heading</a> up the right way. If not, we'd call it an adventure and were happy just to be outside enjoying the weather. We followed the switchbacks up and up and up, checking my GPS for our elevation. The viewpoint we were aiming for was at 2800'. We finally saw a Mt Washington <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11035">sign</a> at about 2650'. I'm glad they put the sign close to the Iron Horse trail to let people know they're heading the right way. We followed the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11033">trail</a> a little further until we found a clearing cut in the trees. After taking a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11034">pictures</a> we continued on. We thought there was suppose to be a bench at the viewpoint. After hiking quite a distance more, I noticed we were above 3000'. I didn't think the book would be that off so I pulled it out and noticed the description included an extended trip option - to continue following the trail for another 4 miles to the summit at 4040'. We called the hike done there and started back down.
			</p>
			<p>
			There was some snow above about 2700' so it was a little chilly and we were ready to find some of that sunshine again. As we passed the viewpoint Carla pointed out the stone 'bench' against the rock face. We made it back down the trail, eager to see where we ended up on the Iron Horse trail to figure out how we missed the trail up to Mt Washington. We emerged on a well defined trail - I have no idea how we missed it by about 30'. It was a great day of sun and adventures though, and a nice little workout. On our way back to Seattle we stopped at the Issaquah Brewhouse for some lunch and drinks. It was a fun restaurant and a great way to end the day's adventure.
