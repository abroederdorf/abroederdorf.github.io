			<h1>Snoqualmie  Falls 3-18-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			We have been getting some great weather in between the rain so I decided to take advantage of it and head to Snoqualmie Falls with Danielle.  A nice after work stroll in the sun to enjoy a beautiful waterfall – sounded good to me.  When I got to the falls I noticed they had made a lot of changes since the prior July when I was there last with Alex during his trip to the northwest.  They are making the top, near the parking lot, a lot nicer – a new fence and sidewalks in some areas.  Of course we weren’t content just to admire the falls from the top so we headed down the short trail and climbed over the railing right next to the warning sign trying to warn people against it.  It was a little weird because we were the only people out on the rocks.  Granted there weren’t many people at the falls in general, but I had never been out on the rocks by myself.  After hanging out for a few minutes, trying to figure out where the little tunnel near the base of the falls leads to, we started back up to the top.  We did pass a few people who we saw out on the rocks when we were back at the top.  People down there really help provide a good perspective for just how high the falls are.  After the falls we grabbed some burgers and called it a night.  It was a nice late week escape from the daily grind of work and the city.
