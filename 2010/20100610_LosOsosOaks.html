			<h1>Los Osos Oaks 6/10/10</h1>
			
			<p>
			Cory was <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11307">graduating</a> from Cal Poly so I decided to head down to help him celebrate his accomplishments.  I had business in California at the beginning of the week so I went up to SLO Wednesday after work, with a quick stop along the way in Danish <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11302">Solvang</a> for some smorgasbord.  Thursday we decided to go for an adventure.  Cory and Scott had found a park they wanted to check out, Los Osos Oaks.  I just had a carry on so I had to leave my sunscreen at home.  After we found a CVS so I could get my preferred sunscreen, we continued to the park. I was told it was more of a nature walk than a hike, so I had on some shorts and my running shoes.  As soon as we started on the trail, we saw some awesome <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11297">trees</a>.  I thought it was fun hiking through the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11292">desert</a> like environment and I was admiring all of the different <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11290">trees</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11293">flowers</a> than what we have in Washington - or my normal stomping grounds in Washington. i.e. not the desert in eastern Washington.  There were paths winding their way throughout the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11291">park</a> so we got to choose our own adventure.  We came upon one tree that apparently looked very inviting because before I knew it, both Scott and Cory had <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11289">climbed</a> up into it.  I had my gorillapod along as usual, so I set it up for some pictures including a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11287">group</a> one after I quickly scampered up the tree to join the guys.  </span><br>
			<br>
			After a little bit more <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11286">walking</a> we came upon this awesome <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11285">grove</a> of trees that screamed climbing playground to all of us.  We <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11284">each</a> chose our own <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11283">tree</a> and proceeded to do some climbing.  I know, sober tree climbing in the daylight - not the usual, but still fun.  I guess that was my version of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11280">climbing</a> for the weekend.  After climbing the trees we continued along, passing more <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11277">flowers</a> and finding our way to a dead <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11276">end</a> along the fence of a nearby mobile home park.  We turned around and decided that we should actually head back to the car since we were planning on going with a few people to Firestone for some beer tasting.  We wanted to go back a different way, so after a few wrong turns we finally looped back to the parking lot.  We even passed a couple <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11274">critter</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11273">friends</a> hiding along the path.  The walk was a lot of fun, due mainly to all of the great trees available for climbing.
