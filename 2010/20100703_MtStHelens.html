			<h1>Mt St Helens 7/3/10</h1>
			
			<p>
			Cheryl was up visiting from Texas so we decided to go on a long adventure down at Mt St Helens.  I somehow convinced 4 other people to join me in about 10 hours of driving, with a couple easy hikes thrown in the mix.  Cheryl and I started the day by leaving my place just before 6:30 AM, picking up Carla, and then meeting Ashley and Dan at a park and ride in Kent.  We were on the road by 7AM, right on schedule.  I was trying to find reports on the conditions at Mt St Helens and from what I read, I wasn’t sure if we’d face any snow or not so I was glad that Ashley volunteered Dan and his jeep for the drive.  They had just opened a couple of the roads we needed to take June 25 and June 29 and some of the last trail reports listed the snow line at 3500’, which Windy Ridge is above.
			</p>
			<p>
			We got down to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11342">Ape Caves</a> on the southern end, our first stop, right around 10 AM.  Our plan was to do the hike through the upper cave of the longest lava tube in North America, created 2,000 years ago.  We grabbed our <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11335">headlamps</a>, added a few layers to battle the 40 degree temperatures down there, and set off.  I had my big backpack with me, filled with random items like food, warm clothing, extra sources of light (i.e. headlamp and spotlight), as well as some of my climbing gear like slings and carabiners.  I had done the hike the year before and had no problem, but I thought since I had the stuff, might as well bring it along.  There is an 8’ wall you have to climb up in the middle of the hike so I figured I might be able to use the slings in case we needed help getting someone up it.  I figured carrying some extra weight could only help me too – well, in terms of training.  The backpack did turn me into a turtle a few times, making it extra difficult to maneuver through the cave and of course changed my center of gravity so balancing on the many rocks proved interesting as well.
			</p>
			<p>
			We descended the stairs near the trailhead and were immediately immersed in total darkness.  We started <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11343">up</a> the trail of the upper cave with the aid of our headlamps and soon came upon our first rock pile.  I was leading the group since I had been through once before and supposedly knew what was going on.  I aggressively attacked the first pile of rocks and successfully climbed in a circle, ending up on top of a ledge we had just hiked along the base of.  Luckily Dan had watched me do it so he found the correct way over the rocks and we were back on track.  There was a large group behind us so we let them pass, allowing Dan some time to play with his camera and get some cool shots in the lava tube.  I learned my lesson, stay along the right side and we’d keep making forward progress.  I love the absolute darkness of the lava tubes because it creates its own adventure, but it also makes any sort of navigation nearly impossible.
			</p>
			<p>
			We moved along well as a group, climbing up and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11338">over</a> the numerous rock piles while admiring the interesting rock formations around us.  We found what looked to be some little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11344">stalactites</a> forming above us, some interesting <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11336">rocks</a> that looked like they were a result of the old lava flow, and just the geometry of the tube itself.  I had some fun trying to climb over rock piles that were very near the ceiling with my pack on.  We had several good laughs at my expense.  We finally made it to the 8’ <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11339">wall</a> and I climbed up first.  Carla felt like she was a fairly strong climber so I told her to wait to go up last, since there would be no one to help her up.  There is one good foot hold on the left side, and then some good rock features to grab on at the top.  It’s definitely a lot of upper body since there aren’t many good foot holds.  Everyone made it up and over without the use of any of the goodies in my pack, yay!
			</p>
			<p>
			We continued <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11340">along</a>, finding some more ‘fun’ rocks to climb over and around.  We finally made it to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11337">skylight</a> and knew we were nearing the end.  We passed a large group of people including many kids going the opposite direction of us.  We warned them of the 8’ wall but they continued on, hopefully they made it safely.  The 8’ wall isn’t a huge issue but I certainly rather climb up it than down.  We finally saw the little ladder at the end and took turns climbing up it and out the little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11331">hole</a>.  Finally we emerged into the sun and soon realized how much warmer it was outside.  After shedding some layers and grabbing a snack, we made the 1.3 mile hike back to the car.  There were a lot more people that we met along the way and the parking lot was over crowded – we were definitely grateful to have gotten there so early that morning to avoid some of the congestion.
			</p>
			<p>
			We hopped back into the car for a 2 hour drive to Windy Ridge, our second destination for the day.  We stopped at a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11329">view point</a> along 99 and heard the last bit of a ranger talk which was really interesting.  He was talking about all of the trees that had been <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11326">flattened</a>, telling us how they would decompose in 100 years in that area compared to a more normal 300 year timeline for fallen trees in forests.  The discrepancy is due to the difference in conditions – for example, the trees around Mt St Helens go through a snow cycle every year.  As we drove along the windy road to Windy Ridge we saw a mountain <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11327">shrouded</a> in clouds.  My only hope was for it to clear up so that everyone could see the top.
			</p>
			<p>
			<a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11313">Windy Ridge</a> is definitely windy.  We grabbed sunglasses this time and set off on our 4 mile hike, 2 miles each way.  We found a small patch of snow along the trail but no other white stuff, it was nice and clear.  All of my snow fears were for not. There was some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11325">blue</a> sky opening above us and we were excited to see the clouds moving off the summit, we could see the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11320">crater</a>!  What an awesome view too.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11317">We</a> stopped to take several <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11323">pictures</a> along the hike.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11321">Mt Adams</a> was still covered in clouds in the distance, but we spotted a couple <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11319">waterfalls</a> in the nearby mountains.  I love this hike because it really demonstrates the impact the eruption had on the landscape.  Surrounding mountains are still very <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11312">green</a> while the base of Mt St Helens looks very <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11311">barren</a>, quite the stark <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11310">contrast</a>! 
			</p>
			<p>
			We continued along the trail and finally made it to the end where it led to several other trails that circled the mountain.  Carla and I quickly went up a nearby <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11309">ridge</a> to get a better view and some more pictures, and because I had energy I needed to burn.  The hike was only 4 miles total with about 400’ in elevation gain so I had a lot of left over energy.  As we started back to the car, we noticed the clouds closing in on the crater again.  We were so lucky, it cleared just for our short hike in.  After our hike we elected not to stop at Mt Rainier – Cheryl had already been there and we figured it was also shrouded in clouds.  Instead, we stopped at Red Robin in Puyallup for some dinner before making it back to Seattle.  Overall it was a good day of volcano adventures!</p>
