			<h1>Iron Goat Trail Maintenance 5-23-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			The eleventh and final Boealps outing was our trail maintenance trip.  The Washington Trails Association (WTA) holds work parties throughout the year to complete trail maintenance.  Sunday we and another Boealps team met at the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11184">Iron Goat</a> trailhead off of highway 2 at 8:30 AM.  It was the latest I had gotten to sleep in on a Sunday in months.  We met at the park and ride at 6:45 AM, extremely late compared to meeting at the trailhead by 6:30 AM for all of our other outings.  The weather was overcast and looked pretty threatening.  I signed in, grabbed a WTA hard hat, listened to the safety lecture, grabbed a shovel and hoe, and headed for the upper trail with my team.  The other team worked on the lower trail.
			 </p>
			<p>
			Our task for the day was to continue widening the trail.  The Boealps teams on Saturday had started but there was still a lot of trail left to work on.  We hiked in over 3 miles to the end and decided to work our way back towards the trailhead.  The tools were heavy and it was awkward hiking for so long carrying them.  The hike completely went against the principles we learned in class – eating and drinking on the go, we could accomplish neither.  As we hiked along I decided that I definitely need to come back and explore the old railroad tunnels sometime.  We hiking along the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11176">tunnel</a> for much of the trail, and there were several <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11175">waterfalls</a> cascading over the wall.  We finally reached the end of our line at 10:00 AM, just in time for our morning break.  I was pretty excited for trail maintenance because we had scheduled breaks and lunch time!  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11177">We</a> set our packs down, grabbed some candy for our trip leader, and went to check out the Windy Point <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11181">viewpoint</a> quick before starting on our day’s task.  From the viewpoint you could see the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11180">tunnel</a> that replaced the one that is now home to the trail. It’s almost 8 miles long and has been in service since the 1920’s. The weather was still pretty overcast so there wasn’t much to see.
			 </p>
			<p>
			 We hiked back the quarter mile to our packs and set to work.  We each got a 10 – 15 foot section to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11173">work</a> on, before moving along.  It was kind of fun digging up the sides of the trail to get rid of the vegetation, but it also made me thankful for not having a yard of my own to keep up.  I did feel kind of weird digging vegetation up after how much we stress the ‘leave no trace’ principles.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11170">work</a> was long and tiring. I was using way more arm muscles than leg muscles, definitely a change of pace for a Boealps outing.  The rain came and went, leaving us excited to see sun the few times it appeared.  Finally it was after 2:00 PM and was time to head back to the trailhead.  Our trip leader guessed we had finished about 1500 ft, not too bad considering a lot of that was spent fighting with the rocks littering the trail.  After the long haul back to the trailhead (mostly long just because of carrying the tools again), we made it back and were ready for our last team dinner, at of course the Mexican restaurant Ixtapa in Sultan.

			The end of Boealps is definitely bittersweet.  I can now sleep in, as in wake up later than 5:30 AM, on the weekends.  I can rest and not feel constantly exhausted.  I can see all of those friends that I’ve been ignoring since February and rejoin the real world.  But on the same note, I’m going to miss my weekend adventures in the mountains; questioning why I’m torturing myself on the way up and wondering why I ever questioned anything while on the summit; of challenging the mountains with my team and for the most part being victorious.  My fear is that I will not continue climbing this summer, and with my already packed schedule, that is a great concern.  I learned so many valuable skills in class, now the challenge is to put them to good use and explore this new world that has been opened to me.

			<p>Happy climbing!
