			<h1>Exit 38 - We Did Rock 8.21.10</h1>
			
			<p>
			I had the weekend free and I was looking for some rock to climb outside.  BEWET also had the weekend off so <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12655">Aaron N.</a> decided to get a group together to climb at <a href="http://www.deceptioncrags.com/Exit38.htm">Exit 38</a> along I-90 near North Bend.  It was to be a fun day of climbing - grill, food, beer, and friends.  It was a good group of people heading out, between 10 - 15.  I asked Alyssa if she wanted to go and she jumped at the chance.  Apparently her one half climb in Leavenworth was good enough for her to get hooked, so we stopped at the REI in Issaquah on our way to get her all geared up - harness, shoes, ATC, carabiner, chalk bag and chalk sock.  She had lots of shiny new gear to break in on the rock.

			We arrived to the parking lot just before 11 and disbursed the gear for the short hike up.  I had a couple ropes in my pack, my two harnesses, slings, carabiners, grill, and charcoal.  A few large coolers made the trek up too.  The short (but tough due to my 35 lb pack) hike led us to We Did Rock at <a href="http://www.deceptioncrags.com/Deception/index.htm">Deception Crag</a>.  <a href="http://www.deceptioncrags.com/Deception/WeDidRock/index.htm">We Did Rock</a> has a bunch of 5-9 routes so people set out on leading the routes and setting up the ropes.  I took some time to teach a few newbies how to tie into the rope via the rewoven figure 8 knot, and did a mini belay lesson with Alyssa.  Finally there were some open ropes so I started climbing.

			My first route up was <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/exit_38__deception_crags__mt_washington/we_did_rock/106579554">Some Drugs</a>, with a tricky corner but otherwise a good <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12662">climb</a>.  We Did Rock was all face climbing which I hadn't actually done before.  In Leavenwoth I climbed slab and up in Squamish I climbed cracks so it was another new adventure for me.  As I went up Some Drugs, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12659">Alyssa</a> got her first climb up the 5.9 Absolutely Nothing.  Luckily she had some good support on the ground - mainly Matt belaying her and refusing to let her back down with out making it up to the anchor.  Next <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12657">I</a> also climbed <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/exit_38__deception_crags__mt_washington/we_did_rock/105799843">Absolutely Nothing</a>, followed by some food.  The guys had gotten the grill started and it smelled delicious so I somehow downed 3 Johnsonville Sausages - they were delicious!  After stocking up on food, I thought it was a perfect opportunity for another climb - this time I'd take on <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/exit_38__deception_crags__mt_washington/we_did_rock/106579528">Sobriety</a>.  People were done climbing it so I got the opportunity to clean the route.  Aaron P. had showed me what to do in Leavenworth, but I hadn't done it on my own before so I was looking forward to the challenge.  Becky did a great job of double checking me by having me talk through all of the steps on the ground before she let me climb up.  Everything went well and I surprisingly didn't even drop anything!

			The last route put up was <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/exit_38__deception_crags__mt_washington/we_did_rock/105804241">Blockhead</a>, an interesting overhang route.  I have to admit I was a little intimidated but I took the challenge and succeeded.  Another new experience - dealing with underclings.  After a few of us went up Blockhead it was time to head back to Seattle.  Exit 38 was great - easily accessible from Seattle with some good routes to climb.  I'm definitely looking forward to climb there again, once the weather cooperates.
