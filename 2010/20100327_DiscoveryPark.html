			<h1>Discovery Park 3-27-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			I've had Discovery Park on my calendar for a good 9 months now.  I kept putting it off, or rather, not making time to go check it out.  I woke up around 9 this morning and it seemed like a decent day with some sunshine so I thought it was a perfect opportunity to go check out the park.  I figured I'd be cooped up inside for a good portion of the day, trying to catch up on life that I didn't get to this past week thanks to work.  I was thinking if I spent some of my day outside enjoying the nice weather, I'd feel less guilty later being inside. I wasn't expecting my little 'walk' to turn into almost 6 miles though, haha.  I found my way over to the North Parking lot of the park and set off on my adventure.  I brought along my normal hiking stuff - pack, GPS, camera, water, lunch, and even a blanket in case I decided to sit and relax for a while. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I first made my way over to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10673">Daybreak Star center</a> and caught my first amazing <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10674">glimpse</a> of the Olympic Mountains across the Puget Sound.  It was a pretty hazy, slightly overcast day with the sun trying to force it's way through so the snow caps on the mountains helped make them easier to spot.  After that quick stop I continued along the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10672">loop trail</a> until I met up with the North Beach Trail.  I figured I would take that down to the southern part of the park.  The North Beach Trail is more like a real <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10670">trail</a> - or what I consider a real trail.  It wound through the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10669">trees</a> and was actually quite muddy.  Luckily there were several wooden <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10668">staircases</a> and even a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10667">bridge</a> to give me a reprieve.  I wore my old running shoes so they were slipping a little bit in the mud.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10664">I</a> made it down to the rocky shore finally and took a few more pictures.  There were a ton of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10665">sailboats</a> leaving the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10633">Golden Gardens</a> area.  I don't know what it is, but seeing sailboats on the sound makes it so much prettier.  Finally I continued down the path, right along the coast.  I couldn't have asked for a prettier trail.  I can't complain when my <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10632">view</a> is of the Olympic Mountains towering over the sound.
			</p>
			<p>
			I found a little trail that led down to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10656">beach</a> so I took it.  There were so many <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10666">shells</a> on the beach, I actually saw a lot of the halves still <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10657">connected</a>!  I don't think I had ever seen that before.  I finally reached the tip where the light house is.  I think the light house is still under construction so I didn't check it out, but there was an old, quaint <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10654">house</a> nearby.  I took the trail around to the south beach and grabbed some lunch.  The south <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10652">beach</a> was considerably more busy than the north.  There were a ton of families walking along the water - the kids having fun finding shells, skipping rocks, and playing in the tepee shelters made of drift wood.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10649">bluff</a> at the east end of the beach was really pretty.  I looked out to see a ton of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10653">sailboats</a> just off of Alki, which at first I thought was probably Seattle until I saw the dinosaur like shipping <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10651">cranes</a> from the harbor in another area.  Those helped give me my bearings.  After walking down towards the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10647">bluff</a>, I found my way onto the South Beach trail and continued my 'short' walk around the park.  All those <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10642">steps</a> I had descended to reach North beach, I now got to climb along the South Beach trail.  There were a few vantage points that were pretty nice, offering views of the sound with <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10645">sailboats</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10640">mountains</a>.  
			</p>
			<p>
			There were many pretty <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10638">flowers</a> along the trail and I of course stopped to take pictures of most of them.  I reached the large meadow near the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10641">radar</a> and walked along the streets passed a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10636">church</a> and some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10635">residences</a>.  I thought I was heading back to the north parking lot at this point but there weren't clear trail markers and before I knew it, I was in the south parking lot.  I got myself turned around and heading in the right direction and I finally made it back to the north parking lot and my car.  It was a great stroll through the park, and I really enjoyed walking along the water.  There are so many facets to this park, I can see why so many people like it - there is definitely something for everyone.  I still think Gasworks is my favorite go to park, but the next time I want something more along the lines of hiking and I don't want to go very far, I'll definitely be heading back to Discovery Park.
