			<h1>Mt Ellinor 4/9/10 - 4/11/10</h1>
			
			<p>
			My fifth Boealps outing was to Mt Ellinor in the Olympics, one of the most southeastern mountains.  We were supposed to go to the Gothic Peak/Del Campo area, but it dumped another couple feet of snow in the mountains so our plans changed.  There was another group also going to Mt Ellinor so it was kind of fun to see other friends.  The weekend was our first overnight, and my first time snow camping.  I was a little worried about staying warm while I slept.  Usually people use a 0 or 10 degree bag, but I have a 35 degree bag (I assumed I’d only be doing 3 seasons ever, my bad) and I really didn’t want to drop another $300 on a sleeping bag, so I set off to make mine work.  First step was to get another sleeping pad so I picked up the simple blue closed foam pad at REI for $22.  Next, I found a liner to use that is rated to add another 20 degrees of comfort, for $60.  Those things coupled with my new down jacket (I love it!) and carefully selected layers of clothing, I was able to stay warm.  I’ll talk more about my system later.
			</p>
			<p>
			Mt Ellinor is a couple of hours away from Seattle, so rather than leave at 4 AM to get to the trailhead by 7 AM, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10852">Josh</a> offered a few of us a ride over in his <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10851">RV</a> the night before so we could ‘sleep in’.  Aaron, Nate, Tracy, and myself met Josh at the park and ride in Federal Way, loaded up the Warrior, and started on our weekend adventure.  The RV is really sweet, it sleeps 5, and provides a great source of entertainment and comfort for a road trip.  We stopped along the way to walk down to a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10847">rocky</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10844">beach</a> and take a few pictures.  There were oysters everywhere – I think both Josh and Nate had one.  Nate also turned over some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10846">rocks</a> and found a ton of tiny <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10845">crabs</a>, plus a couple larger ones.  We stopped at Subway to pick up dinner for the night and water for the weekend.  We found our way to the end of 119, near the campground, and continued on forest service road 24 to 2419 to drive up near the trailhead.  There was a little snow on the road but I honestly wasn’t paying attention.  I was in the back and couldn’t really see out the front window, and we had the blinds pulled on the camper windows.  The road started getting buried under more and more snow and all of a sudden we stopped – Josh couldn’t make it any further in the Warrior.  Memories flashed back of when I almost got myself stuck on the mountain on the way to Barclay Lake – I was now in that same situation except in an RV instead of my little car, at night, and with 4 other people.  Nate and Aaron jumped out to try and help direct Josh back down the mountain – one lane forest service roads don’t really provide an opportunity to turn around, especially in an RV.  The RV was lurching a lot as they were trying to move, so I felt more comfortable going outside.  Tracy and I stood in the headlights to stay out of the way, but the guys had noticed some fresh tracks – a mountain lion.  I guess they heard things so they asked us girls to go back inside – I couldn’t decide which was worse, falling down the cliff in the RV or getting eaten by the mountain lion.  Tracy and I went back in the RV and helplessly sat hoping the guys would get us back into safety.  For protection, the guys grabbed ice axes as they walked along the road with the RV.  We finally made it out of the snow to an intersection in the forest service road, so we stopped for the night.  To use our strength in numbers, we took a bedtime bathroom break together to help deter the big cat from picking anyone off.
			</p>
			<p>
			We woke up about 6 to try and get ready, and we ended up having to drive back down to that intersection near the campground to meet the rest of the team.  As soon as we got down there, we drove back up to where we had just been.  This time we stopped where we had camped the night before, and jumped in some smaller, 4-wheel drive vehicles to continue the trip to the trailhead.  We kept getting stuck in the snow and finally decided we had gone as far as we could.  We grabbed the shovels and cleared a little parking area for our two cars to park in, to let other people pass if they could.  After figuring out the sleeping arrangements and dividing up the tent to carry with us, we hit the trail – or <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10843">road</a> in our case.  We still had to hike a little over a mile along the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10842">road</a> before we hit the lower <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10841">trailhead</a>.  Unfortunately I was not feeling very well, I had a very nauseous stomach and couldn’t get myself to eat.  I had started to feel bad the night before and had actually not touched any of my subway.  The illness just made the hike miserable.  We were following the other team for a while, but when we finally hit fresh snow along the trail, we took the lead to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10838">kick steps</a> for a while and give them a break.
			</p>
			<p>
			About 2:30 my lead instructor thought we had found a good <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10837">spot</a> to set-up camp so we stopped and did just that.  I thought it was still a ways to the summit but the area was actually a really good choice.  It was relatively flat and protected from wind.  Tracy, Amenda, and I were going to be bunking together so we started clearing our area – which consists of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10836">compacting</a> all of the snow.  It almost looks like we’re squishing grapes for wine making – stomping and jumping around in the snow to compress everything.  Once we had a nice flat base, we set up the tent.  Setting up the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10832">tent</a> was pretty much like normal camping except when it came to putting in the anchors.  There are special snow anchors and you need to bury them like a deadman to keep them from coming out of the snow.  Amenda and I worked to setup the tent while Tracy dug us a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10831">bathroom</a> near a tree, a most important thing.  Best of all is she shoveled a path straight over from our tent.  Once everyone had set up their tents most of the team continued onto the summit.  It was a gorgeous day out (we finally had nice weather) and they didn’t want to sit around, so they made the Mt Ellinor summit.  Not feeling well I decided to stay behind.  The one thing about snow camping is that you want to be moving around to stay warm, so although staying back at <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10829">camp</a> helped me feel better, it also made me cold.  I did walk over to the other Boealps camp which was nearby, to check out their <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10826">view</a> and get my muscles working.  We also watched the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10827">group</a> climb up the mountain.  After sitting around in our kitchen for a while, I started the process of melting snow for water – for both cooking and to replenish our water bottles.  To melt snow you want to have some water already in the pot.  The group got back just after I had started the melting process so everyone got their <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10824">dinner</a> ready and started filling water bottles.  I made some ramen noodles for dinner, although I still couldn’t eat much.  I filled up part of my water bottle with some of the nice hot water, so I stuck that in my coat to act as a heater.
			</p>
			<p>
			Everyone finished dinner around 7 so we started filling the rest of the water bottles before heading to bed.  The sun would soon be <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10823">setting</a> and there was nothing else for us to do, so the best choice was to crawl into our sleeping bags to warm up and go to sleep.  We had a pretty late wake up call of 5:30 the next morning, so plenty of time for some sleep.  The trick is to take your warm water bottle into your sleeping bag to help heat it up.  I placed mine down by my feet since they needed the most help.  I also grabbed my socks for the next day to warm them up, and slept on my boot insoles so they would be warm.  There’s a lot of planning to get things dry and warm when snow camping.  My sleeping system isn’t perfect but it kept me warm throughout the night.  I never woke up cold or hot, I was just right.  Here’s what it consisted of: my base layer t-shirt, 3 long sleeve shirts, 1 fleece jacket, 1 down jacket, long underwear, another pair of pants, wool socks, neck gaiter, hat, mittens, liner, sleeping bag, and 2 sleeping pads.  I also slept in the middle to help use my tent mates as heating sources.  When I woke up the next morning I was really happy to have stayed warm, I felt successful!
			</p>
			<p>
			I woke up and packed up my sleeping pad and sleeping bag.  I figured it was best to do it while I was still warm than after my summit attempt.  The adventurous group from the day before took off for A-Peak.  When they got close they determined the conditions weren’t great, so they summited another peak they dubbed ‘B-Peak’.  I was feeling better but I hadn’t been able to eat much so I was feeling a little weak.  Luckily we didn’t have to take much with us so my pack was relatively light – just my first aid, 10 essentials, some extra clothing, food, and water.  I let Rich know how I was feeling so the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10818">team</a> was really good about taking a few extra breaks for me.  Towards the top it was hitting me hard though, good thing the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10816">summit</a> wasn’t further away.  We got to the ridgeline and I took a quick break to force some pretzels down – and force I did.  We finished the last little bit to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10815">summit</a>, took a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10787">pictures</a>, and headed back to the ridgeline so we weren’t quite so exposed to enjoy some summit treats.  The other part of our team was on the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10814">summit</a> of B-Peak so we waved and yelled at each other.  You’re not often summiting with another group so close by so that was fun.
			</p>
			<p>
			The trek back to camp was filled with lots of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10813">glissading</a> and a few plunge steps - so much fun!  I was able to get a few good pictures of my teammates <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10803">glissading</a> down too.  I kicked up too much snow a few times and white washed myself, but otherwise I had a blast sliding down the mountain.  We packed up camp and hit the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10790">trail</a> to hike the few miles back to the car.  The hike back always seems so much longer!  The road especially seemed long, but Stef and I made it back finally.  Since we were just following the road for the last mile the group split up a little more, so the two of us hiked back together.  We finally made it back to the cars and I was overjoyed to shed my pack, my back was killing me.  After changing into some fresh clothes we hit the road and grabbed lunch at a little Mexican restaurant on the water.  They looked at us like we were crazy when we wanted to eat outside on the dock.  I guess they thought it was too cold or windy, but it was nice to us after snow camping for the weekend.  I did put on some sunscreen specifically for lunch though, no sunburn for me, haha.  Overall it was another good weekend filled with lots of adventures!
