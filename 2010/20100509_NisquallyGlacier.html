			<h1>Nisqually Glacier 5-9-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			The ninth Boealps outing was to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11045">Mt Rainier</a> for crevasse rescue training on the Nisqually Glacier on the south side by Paradise.  In a last minute decision, we decided to head down late Saturday night and sleep in the warrior.  I woke up to the sun rising over some of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11044">Tatoosh</a> range, it was such a gorgeous day!  Blue skies, hardly any clouds – what a difference from the prior week when we were trying to climb Eagle Peak in the Tatoosh.  I finally got to see what the peaks actually look like since we never did see them.  There were some heated bathrooms at the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11073">parking lot</a></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> which was a nice treat for getting ready for the day.  I applied  sunscreen and got my sun <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11049">protection</a> ready – buff, hat, and sunglasses.  With everything on only the bridge of my nose showed, unfortunately I also fogged up my glasses with each breath so I ended up lowering the buff so my nose was exposed.
			</p>
			<p>
			We set off from the parking lot just a little late.  I had a rope this week and it killed me.  I’m not sure if it was the extra weight of the rope, the altitude, or a combination of both but I was having a really hard time breathing.  When the group stopped to put crampons on Tracy amazingly offered to carry the rope for me!  She was definitely a life saver.  The snow wasn’t really ideal for crampons but we got to practice putting them on and walking a bit.  We finally reached the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11070">glacier</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11069">roped</a> up in teams of 4.  Normally you avoid <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11066">crevasses</a> but we were actually headed towards them for our training.  However, we still needed to be <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11068">roped</a> up for any hidden crevasse someone may accidentally fall into.  Being roped up would allow us to pull the person out.  It was a long haul up to our glacier at just shy of 8,000’.  It was slow going, mostly due to me.  We had our harnesses on since we were roped up, so that with my pack pushing down on it, the harness killed my hip bones and I have some awesome bruises.
			</p>
			<p>
			We finally reached our crevasse and the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11043">team</a> was busy setting up anchors so we could start our rescues.  We worked in teams of four, one person getting lowered into the crevasse, one person back-up belaying them, and then two climbers working to haul the person out.  The middle climber is responsible for holding the fallen climbers weight while arresting, allowing the first climber to set up an anchor and bachmann to hold the weight.  Once the bachmann knot is in place, the first climber checks on the fallen climber, and then sets up the traveling pulley while the middle climber sets up the fixed pulley.  Finally the system is ready and the hard work of pulling the fallen climber out begins.  Stef and I were responsible for pulling out Brock first, an extreme test.  After another 5 or so people joined us, we finally got him out.  I was exhausted and was happy to be the next fallen climber.

			I dressed warmly expecting a cold <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11061">crevasse</a> but it was actually pretty warm down there.  Once I was lowered in, while my teammates were setting up the Z-pulley system, I practice my Texas prusik.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11053">Texas prusik</a> is made of two prusiks, one for your waist and one with two slings for your feet so you can climb up the rope to get out.  I only prusiked up a little ways so my team could still get practice pulling me out.  Fortunately I got up just high enough to see out of the crevasse, I had a great view of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11057">Mt Adams</a> while I hung there!  The crevasse was interesting, I kind of wanted to go exploring.  There was a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11060">shadowy</a>, ice tunnel of sorts in one part, some huge <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11059">icicles</a> hanging near the lip, and a bright sunny hallway the other direction.  Finally my team was ready and away I went, they pulled me up quite easily.
			</p>
			<p>
			I belayed Stef as she was lowered, and then helped <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11052">Brock</a> pull Chuck out.  I had the fun job of self-arresting Chuck, a factor that didn’t help the bruises forming on my hips.  Brock had a genius method of using a couple prusiks to haul Chuck up so that we could sort of run up and away from the crevasse rather than using our arms to try and pull him out.  Again, after some additional help, we finally got Chuck out and it was time to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11050">pack up</a> and head down.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11065">views</a> were amazing, it was so clear out.  The glacier seemed like a never ending <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11048">expanse</a> of snow too, it was really pretty.  After we got the pulley systems broken down, we roped up again for safety in crossing the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11047">glacier</a> and started back to the parking lot.  I always like going down the mountain, so much less effort – at least when there’s fresh snow to plunge step in.  We reached the parking lot, debriefed, headed to Wild Berry for some Nepalese food, and finally headed home.  After dinner I passed out in the Warrior on the way home, exhausted from a fun day on a glacier.  I can’t believe our graduation climb is next week, to the summit of Mt Baker!

			<p>The GPS got turned off in my pocket at some point, I think it was while I was being lowered into the crevasse, so I have data for going up and down separately.
