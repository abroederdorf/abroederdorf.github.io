			<h1>Wilderness Peak 1-23-10</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was overcast in Seattle but as I drove south the rain started.  I found the trailhead along 900 and found a spot in the small parking lot.  I put on my rain pants and stuck my camera in the waterproof case before crossing a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10485">bridge</a> to start the hike.  I met a few hikers at the very beginning but didn't meet anyone else for about another mile.  The trail was muddy but I expected some mud due to the rain.  There were several <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10484">bridges</a> along the trail, a fun way to break up the hike.  There were also a few trail junctions.  I reached the first one about 0.5 miles into the hike.  This junction started the loop, and following the guidance in my hiking book, I took the trail to the left to complete the hike in a clockwise direction.  The trail was through the trees, but they were pretty green and there were several large <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10482">boulders</a> here and there.  It wasn't the real dense forest I've hiked through on other trails, which I prefer.  It's more mysterious and cave like in the dense forest, more of an adventure.

			I came across this little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10481">boardwalk</a> section which was really cool, one of my favorite parts of the hike.  After taking a few pictures and trying to dry off the camera case, I encountered a couple so I tried stepping off of the main boardwalk onto the support logs below.  It was a little tight but they managed to pass and I continued on the trail.  About 1.5 miles into the hike I reached the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10480">Shy Bear Pass</a>, a major trail junction.  One of the trails led back to the main part of Cougar mountain  but I continued on to Wilderness peak.  As I hiked up, I noticed how <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10479">hazy</a> it was in the trees.  I think I was hiking through a cloud.
			</p>
			<p>
			Finally I reached the last trail junction for the short side trail up to the peak.  At the top, instead of views like I am normally rewarded with, I found a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10478">bench</a> - apparently dedicated in loving tribute to someone - and a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10477">journal</a> to sign.  The first page asked for hikers to leave a message for the shy bears, which is apparently a tradition on that trail.  After leaving a short message I continued back to the trail and took the Wilderness Cliffs trail to complete the loop.  There was a little side trail to an 'overlook', I got a glimpse of some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10473">mountains</a> through the trees.  It was still very <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10476">cloudy</a> near the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10475">top</a>, but I did notice a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/10474">bright light</a> through the trees which I presumed was the hidden sun.  I finally made it back to the loop junction and finished the last half mile to reach the car.  It was not the most exciting hike but convenient and a good way to get some exercise.
