			<h1>Zoe and Mike Visit Seattle</h1>
			
			<p>
			Zoe came out to visit me in Seattle!  There were no natural disasters (tornados) or extreme illnesses (pneumonia) either! Mike was able to come enjoy the Pacific  Northwest too and I think they enjoyed their time here - I certainly did.  Their main objective was to get out of the city and enjoy <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12815">nature</a> as much as possible.  They both live in Chicago so they were ready for some clean air.  The weather sort of cooperated so hopefully they got a good fill of mountains, although there is already talk of another trip in the near future so I don't think the mountain adventures are over yet.  Zoe and Mike landed Saturday night and Sunday we dove straight into our first adventure.  We left Seattle about 8AM and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12754">headed</a> south down I-5, our objective was Husum to go white water <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12749">rafting</a> on the White Salmon.  It was a bit dreary with clouds hanging low obscuring any real views of the mountains.  Of course Saturday as I drove to the airport Mt Rainier was out in full force, but it was too dark for them to see and the clouds quickly moved in.  We found our way to the <a href="http://www.wetplanetwhitewater.com/">Wet Planet</a> headquarters, the commercial outfit we were rafting with, and got <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12733">geared</a> up.  I've never gone with a commercial outfitter, only BEWET, so I was interested to see how different it would be.  They provided all the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12731">gear</a> - farmer john/jane wet suit, booties, fleece, and splash jacket in addition to the normal safety items like a helmet and personal floatation device (life jacket).  We got the general river description, walked over to check out the waterfall we'd have the option of rafting over, and loaded onto the buses.  There were 4 or 5 boats total and our boat was filled up with a few members of a bachelorette party.
			</p>
			<p>
			After the typical safety lecture down by the river (which I knew well thanks to BEWET) we <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12729">loaded</a> up the boats and took off down the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12728">river</a>.  Zoe and I volunteered to be in the front of the boat, my first time ever.  I was definitely thankful for all the gear they supplied as my own thrown together gear doesn't always keep me as warm.  After the trip I got my own farmer jane, opting for the full leg covering over my shortie, and I'm on the lookout for a good deal on a splash jacket.  The water was a bit cold and I was getting drenched in the rapids, but it was a lot of fun.  There were several little channels that our guide had us sit in the boat to go through which was very different for me, but then again it was my first time on the White Salmon.  At one point we had to get out of the raft and hike a little along the river.  We came to a 17' <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12725">cliff</a> and had the option of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12721">jumping</a> into the river to get back to the boats or to hike down a sketchy hill side.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12724">Mike</a> was the first one to jump in and Zoe was pumped for the jump as well, so I put my normal water apprehension aside and jumped in too.  I was a little nervous about hitting the 'sweet' spot in the middle of the river but all must have gone well because I found my way back into the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12723">boat</a>.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12720">We</a> were back on the river and I was enjoying the scenery. Our guide said the river was an old <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12719">lava tube</a> from Mt Adams. After the cliff jumping, our next major challenge was the 13' <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12742">waterfall</a> - Husum Falls.  The guide stepped us through what we'd need to do to get <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12745">over</a> the falls in the boat. The other three girls decided to opt out for the waterfall so it was Zoe, Mike, me, and the guide. I handed off my camera to one of the girls so we got a great <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/videos/42">video</a> of the action.  With only 4 people in the boat, we weren't very heavy and sort of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12740">bounced</a> off the water rather than being completely <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12741">submerged</a>, but it was a lot of fun and everyone managed to stay in the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12736">boat</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			After we changed into dry clothing we started <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12752">towards</a> Mt St Helens.  That night we'd be <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12718">camping</a> part way there at Panther Creek campground.  We found our campsite, some fire wood, set up the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12717">tents</a>, and got the fire roaring.  We cooked some sausage over the fire, had a couple beers, made s'mores, talked around the fire, and finally turned in for the night.  The next morning we woke up at 7AM to get a little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12785">food</a> in us and pack up.  Our first stop was <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12776">Ape Caves</a> at Mt St Helens, my favorite hike to take visitors on. We were going to do the lower cave but once we actually got down in the to see the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12771">cave</a>, we opted for the more challenging and fun upper cave that took us over <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12764">boulder</a> piles and up an 8' <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12780">wall</a>.  We made good progress and I think Zoe and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12783">Mike</a> enjoyed going through the cave - mostly scrambling over all the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12757">boulder</a> piles.  One of my <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12769">headlamps</a> was acting up so I traded Zoe for it and used it on the lower setting.  We arrived at the 8' <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12760">wall</a> and made it over no problem.  Zoe, Mike, and I all took turns leading and it was fun following Zoe's '<a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12768">light-up</a>' steps thanks to her pants.  We finally arrived at the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12778">spotlight</a> and I knew we were getting close - about time because my stomach was getting ready for food.  Near the ladder out my headlamp finally gave out, but lucky for me I had my ridiculously bright spot light with me so I used that the rest of the time.  I was glad to have a head lamp for most of the hike though, I liked having my hands free for scrambling.  We <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12777">emerged</a> from the cave to a light drizzle and headed straight back to the car.  Our first adventure of the day was done but we had a couple more to go.

			Next stop on my Mt St Helens tour was Windy Ridge, a great view of the mountain and surrounding <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12797">devestation</a>.  Unfortunately the clouds were still hanging low so we just got quick glimpses of parts of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12789">mountain</a>.  We drove into the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12799">blast zone</a>, with a quick stop at <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12798">Spirit Lake</a> changes, and arrived at Windy Ridge which lives up to its name. We donned  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12796">hats</a> and set off on the trail.  Luckily the clouds decided to cooperate a little bit and we got some decent views of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12788">mountain</a>.  Thanks to my gorillapod we even managed a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12790">group</a> pictures.  It was starting to get late and we still wanted to do a little hiking at Mt Rainier, so we turned back about a mile or a mile and a half in.  Just in time too because on our way back it started raining.
			</p>
			<p>
			We drove a couple more hours and arrived in the Mt Rainier national park.  We stopped at <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12823">Relfection Lakes</a> but Mt Rainier was still doing a great job of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12805">hiding</a>.  We continued on to Paradise and did a little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12816">hiking</a> along the trails there.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12821">wildflowers</a> were in bloom and the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12822">meadows</a> were so beautiful.  We were even treated to lots of wildlife - <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12817">deer</a>, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12819">birds</a>, and a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12812">marmot</a> munching away on some flowers near the trail. The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12826">Tatoosh</a> range was out and so I talked about out BCC outing on Eagle - I mean <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12818">Chutla</a>.  On our way down from Paradise we made a couple more stops at some of the waterfalls along the way - both <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12806">Narada</a> Falls and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/12801">Christine</a> Falls, beautiful as usual. I'm not sure what it is about waterfalls but I sure do like them. Finally we packed up and headed back to Seattle. The weekend mountain adventures were done, but Zoe and Mike were staying for a few more days.
			</p>
			<p>
			I had hoped to do some hiking after work on Tuesday and Wednesday with them, but the weather didn't cooperate so we opted for a Redhook Brewery Tour and dinner on Tuesday, and some indoor rock climbing at Vertical World on Wednesday.  Thursday was their last day in Seattle so I took the day off and we headed out early, 6AM-ish, for a quick hike before their flight back to Chicago.  We went to my favorite after work - or in this case, in-lieu of work - hike, Rattlesnake Ledge.  Finally, the weather decided to cooperate and we had a gorgeous day for hiking.  The sun was out, blue skies all around - and they finally got to see this mountain I kept talking about, Mt Rainier.  It was out and very dominant.  Zoe and Mike powered up Rattlesnake Ledge and we had fun getting some of the great views from the ledge in pictures.  They ran up and down the mountain so quickly that we even had time to do a couple last sightseeing things.  We stopped at Snoqualmie Falls and were drenched from the spray - the water was certainly gushing over.  Unfortunately the trail to the bottom is closed so we just admired it from the top.  Then it was on to Kerry Park for some views of the city - with Mt Rainier in the background of course - topped off with breakfast at Beth's.  It was a great week with Zoe and Mike and I'm glad that they seemed to really enjoy their time in the mountains.  I'll have to come up with some more great adventures for the next trip to the great Pacific Northwest.

			I didn't use my GPS for any of our adventures on the White Salmon, at Mt St Helens, or at Mt Rainier so here they are for our last hike of the week at Rattlesnake Ledge:
