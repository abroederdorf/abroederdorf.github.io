			<h1>Mt Baker Grad Climb 5/15 - 5/16/10</h1>
			
			<p>
			The tenth outing for Boealps, and possibly the most important/fun, was our graduation climb at <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11161">Mt Baker</a>.  We were meeting at the ranger station in Sedro-Woolley at 6AM Saturday morning.  To avoid waking up incredibly early again, Aaron, Josh, Tracy, and I took the Warrior and camped in the parking lot the night before.  A little different from what we were used to, we had actual bathrooms in the nearby gas station and Rite-Aid.  We left work early Friday to try and beat traffic up I-5.  We loaded up on carbohydrates with a pasta dinner at Cascade Pasta and Pizza in Sedro and then relaxed for the rest of the evening.
			</p>
			<p>
			We woke up just after 5:30 AM Saturday morning and met the team in the parking lot to sign in at the station.  We didn't end up leaving the ranger station until between 6:30 and 7:00 AM, so a little later start than we would have liked.  We arrived at the 'trailhead' and started getting our gear ready.  The road was <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11075">snowed</a> in about a half mile from the actual trailhead so we had a little warm up.  Meredith had her scale there so I learned I was carrying a 39 pound pack - what fun!  That's basically a third of my body weight, maybe I should have tried training a bit more.  We finally set off at 8:30 AM and took a quick pit stop at the actual <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11077">trailhead</a> which had bathrooms.
			</p>
			<p>
			The first couple of miles through Schrieber Meadow were relatively flat and the trail wound through the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11080">trees</a>.  Unfortunately we were taking the Easton/Railroad grade route up so we were accompanied by many <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11155">snowmobilers</a>.  I never really had any feelings/opinions about them before this - I kind of hate them now.  Listening to them and sucking in their fumes did not result in pleasant conditions.  It was actually pretty warm out so we took another break to adjust layers.  I took off my long sleeve shirt, only to realize a little while later that the sunscreen I applied would only help in preventing sun burn, not an allergic reaction so I pulled out my lighter weight long sleeve shirt and that worked really well.  Aaron also lent me a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11091">bandanna</a> so I could cover my face.  My buff was too tight and didn't allow enough air flow so the bandanna was key in my sun protection.  I really need to get one of the desert hats. I had one in hand when I was in REI but I figured between my buff and hat I'd be ok - lesson learned for the future.
			</p>
			<p>
			We finally made it out of the meadow and started up the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11093">ridge</a> we needed to follow.  Mt Baker just seemed like a huge <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11092">expanse</a> of snow we some how needed to get to the top of.  It was a beautiful day with sunshine and views of the surrounding <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11095">mountains</a>.  The north cascades are my favorite because of how many mountains there are, the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11087">views</a> are <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11168">incredible</a>.  We were moving pretty well as a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11100">team</a>, keeping a nice slow pace.  I think the heavier packs made it easier for everyone to travel at a slower pace.  Nearly to the top of the ridge we came up against a large <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11088">crack</a>.  I didn't think much of it until I was crossing it and realized it was just a big hole.  Once atop the ridge, we had a much clearer line to follow up the mountain.
			</p>
			<p>
			At 3:30 PM we were at just over 6500' and had found a relatively flat area so we set up <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11106">camp</a>.  Everyone set up their tents (I was bunking with Meredith and Stephen this trip), set up snow walls to help block the wind, dug out a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11108">kitchen</a>, and the all important <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11118">bathroom</a>.  Once people got a good start on setting up the tents, a few team members started the task of melting water for drinking and cooking.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11112">Brock</a> did a superb job of efficiently filling water bottles and distributing water for cooking.  A majority of the team decided to do pho, a noodle dinner, with people bringing different items to add for flavor like basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, vegetables, and sriracha aka rooster sauce.  I opted for a backcountry freeze dried dinner, Jamaican bbq chicken which was a rice based dinner.    We also set up the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11119">ropes</a> for the next day and got our spots ready.  We planned on an all girls rope with Tracy, Meredith, Stef, and I.  I took one of the middle spots and tied my prusiks on, laid all of the ropes over my ice ax, and covered it with my helmet so it was all ready for me in the morning.  Our plan was to wake up at midnight to start the final summit push, so as soon as I was done with dinner and had gotten my water replenished, I went to bed.  I crawled into my new 10 degree bag about 6:30 PM and fell asleep within about 20 minutes I think.  I did wake up to the wind several times, but overall I slept pretty well.
			</p>
			<p>
			My alarm went off at midnight, and after sleeping for another five minutes, I put my plastic pants (aka waterproof pants) and boots on, and made sure <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11120">everyone</a> else was getting up.  I ate part of a bagel and a gu before finding my way over to my spot on the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11121">rope</a>.  Our team opted to forgo crampons at the beginning.  Finally everyone was roped up and Rich took the lead up the mountain in the dark. I don't think we actually got going until close to 1:30 AM.  Traveling on a rope team in the wee hours of the morning is rough.  You're a good distance away from <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11122">people</a> so you can't really talk, it's dark out so you can't see anything, and you're extremely tired and trying to fight to keep your eyes open.  Talk about solitude and personal inner strength.  Going up our first steep sections I was feeling pretty good and was really excited about summiting.  Brock was at the end of the first rope team so he'd yell to Rich 'wand' when he reached a wand, so they were evenly spaced.  The wands proved key in finding our way back to camp in the daylight even, since we couldn't see where we were going in the morning.
			</p>
			<p>
			Above 8500' I started feeling pretty bad, I was really nauseous.  We finally took another break at about <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11123">9200'</a> around 6:00 AM and I didn't think I could endure another 1600' so I decided I should head back to camp rather than dragging the team down with me.  Luckily I think both Rich and Jim were OK with turning around with me, so we adjusted the rope teams and bid farewell and good luck to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11136">team</a> as they continued on their <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11128">journey</a> to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11133">summit</a>.  I handed my camera off to Brock so I still have <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11141">pictures</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11131">from</a> the summit, even though I have no idea what they are of exactly.  It took Rich, Jim, and I about 2 hours to make it back to camp.  I was glad I had decided to turn around because each breath on the way down was painful, it felt like I had a bad chest cold - definitely not a pleasant experience for continuing.  Close to our destination Rich got tired of the rope so he suggested we untie and see if it could find its own way back to camp.  We let it go and it did well, ending at the third wand from camp.  When I reached the rope I started to flake it and was about to coil it when Jim said I should just pull it back to camp with me first, so I did just that.  I have to imagine it was a pretty funny sight.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once I got my gear put away I crawled back into my sleeping bag to sleep until the team returned to camp.  I set my alarm to wake Rich though to let him melt water and get it ready for the team's return.  After sleeping for a few hours I definitely felt better, but also worse because my disappointment set in of being so close to the summit.  Mt Baker is definitely on my to-do list, I will summit someday.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11143">teams</a> got back to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11145">camp</a> just after noon and they looked exhausted.  I was told it was freezing cold at the summit and the views weren't much better than when I had left so I supposedly didn't miss much - I think they were just trying to cheer me up.  They also told me about the vents at the top and the sulfur, I didn't realize Mt Baker was so active still.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11146">I</a> handed out my 'yay, you guys made it back to camp' treats - peanut butter bars. After everyone had a short <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11147">break</a> we started breaking down <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11148">camp</a>.  So far the weather had held out really well but there were some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11149">storm</a> clouds in the distance so we wanted to get going.
			</p>
			<p>
			Going down is always so much easier than going up.  We were <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11151">plunge</a> stepping like champs - when we figured out our route back.  We got back atop the ridge we had come up and followed that for a while.  We had to cross the huge <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/11158">crack</a> again before we could glissade down to the valley below.  Finally we were back to Schriebers meadow, the really long portion.  It seemed a lot longer than I remembered and unfortunately it had started to rain so I covered my pack and put on my shell for the first time during the whole trip.  We missed a turn and ended up further down the road from the trailhead but that worked out well.  We finally made it back to the cars and I was really excited to get out of my dirty, smelly clothes.  We drove back to Sedro-Woolley and had our grad climb team dinner at a Mexican restaurant - the quesadillas were delicious.  Even though I didn't make the summit, I had a lot of fun on the outing.  Class is almost over and it's bitter sweet.  I won't have to wake up early every weekend and torture myself, but I'm definitely going to miss it and the people.  Hopefully I'll go on a few more climbs this summer and keep up with things because it is definitely an awesome and challenging hobby.
