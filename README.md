Personal website to host trip reports from outdoor adventures including hiking, mountaineering, rock climbing, skiing, running, 
rafting, and races. 

Search: There is a search function to allow visitors to filter the 200+ trip reports by an assortment of filters. The user can also
sort the results with a number of options.

Database Management: There are two pages to create the database management portion for using the Firebase database backend. One page 
is used for adding new trip reports to the database, while the other provides the functions to update data entires or remove them.

To-Do: Update styling of website to using bootstrap. Files already included in this directory, need to update trip report pages themselves.
