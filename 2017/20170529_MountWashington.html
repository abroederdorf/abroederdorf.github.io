			<h1>Mount Washington 5.29.17</h1>
			
			<p>
			I wanted to do a hike with about 3000’ of elevation gain. I’ve done a few at 2500’ or less so I wanted to take the next step up in trying to get back in shape. After searching through my old trip reports, searching WTA, and taking suggestions from Matt we finally settled on Mount Washington along I-90 in North Bend. I had done it with Sara in March of 2013 but we climbed it mostly in snow and in a cloud. Aaron hadn’t been so I thought it might be a good objective for us. I snoozed the alarm a few times as neither of us wanted to get up, so we hit the road a little before 9am and headed for the Olallie State Park trailhead at Exit 38. The parking lot had one side almost filled with cars when we arrived. Aaron is planning to climb Rainier again so he brought two gallons of extra water with him to add a bit of training weight. We geared up (i.e. put on lots of sunscreen) and left the trailhead at 9:40am.

			We followed the little trail from the parking lot up to the road, which then met up with the Iron Horse trail - the old train trestle trail. This path followed the signs for the Twin Falls trail. We hiked along the Iron Horse trail a bit until we saw the signatory rock cairn on the left side, so we headed up the trail into the trees. If you hit the trail for Twin Falls you’ve gone too far. We headed up the fairly steep trail through the trees with the sweat rolling down. I can’t remember the last time I was sweating that much. The allergy forecast was very high as well which meant it was hard for Aaron to breath. We took a couple quick breaks along the first mile and a half. One break was so I could unzip my pant legs and hike in shorts. I didn’t want to take my boots off though so I hiked the rest of the day with my pant legs around my ankles.

			We finally made it to the viewpoint, i.e. the clearing in trees with a some rocks to sit on at the back of the trail. We took another break here and talked about what we wanted to do. I think we had both recovered a little from the initial effort so we continued on.

			We had passed three groups at this point so the trail was relatively quiet. We continued hiking on the nice trail through the trees. We passed the trail junction with the Great Wall trail but continued ahead and soon hit the first big creek crossing. The water was running pretty good but it was easy for us to cross on the rocks.

			We continued up the rocky trail from here, and started meeting the first of the hikers heading down from the summit. I was checking my GPS as we went, garnering motivation as we gained elevation and closed in on the summit. We broke out of the nice shade a few times.

			We crossed the creek again and hit the first bigger stretch of snow. There was a nice boot pack and I don’t think we postholed once. We had brought our micro spikes so we decided to put them on earlier rather than later. Before long we were on a dirt slope in the sun so we took them off and stashed them for the rest of the hike. We certainly didn’t need to use them but we had them, so why not. I put a bit more sunscreen on my legs to make sure my knees were protected and we started up the last set of switchbacks to the top.

			It was warm in the sun and the trail was fairly steep. We encountered small patches of snow here and there but all were easy to cross. As we hit the final road crossing before the summit we came upon a group. Aaron offered them some of his training water and they gladly took it for themselves and their pups. He got rid of about a half gallon. We continued up the last little bit of trail and were soon rewarded with the views to the south - Mount Rainier, mountains, Masonry Pool, and Chester Morse Lake.

			After taking a few pictures we continued another couple minutes to reach the true summit. There were a a couple groups on the rocks there. We took in the views from near the radio tower before finding our way into the trees and some shade. We lucked out that day with views of a faint Mount Baker and Glacier Peak to the north too.

			Aaron offered the group up there the rest of his training weight water and a couple people gladly took it as they had run out. Aaron was able to give away all two gallons instead of dumping it out. Glad he could help out on the hot day! We actually stayed at the summit for quite some time eating and relaxing. As we were about to head down Melissa and Jim reached the summit so we chatted and caught up for a bit. It had taken us two hours and forty minutes to reach the summit, and one hour and forty minutes to get back down to the car - all in all about 5 hours car to car. We kept a steady pace down with maybe a 20 second break at the viewpoint. I was happy to get out of my sweaty clothes and sit in the car when we got back. Overall it was a great hike and I was impressed with the views I had missed last time. Definitely a good hike to keep in mind along I-90 that’s not quite as busy.
