			<h1>2017 Year in Review</h1>
			
			<p>I started a new career with a new company and finished school in 2017, as well as got back to doing some of the activities I love so much. The big goal for the year was a Grand Canyon trip through my work so I had to get in shape for that. Otherwise it was getting back in the gym to build up my grip strength, trying to get my lead head back outside, and sliding around on the snow. We also took a few trips to see people so 2017 was a good mix of outdoor activities and catching up with friends.</p>

			<!--Skiing stats-->
			<h4 class="statsTitle">Skiing Stats</h4>
			<p>My graduation present from Aaron was a new pair of skis. I wanted some wider but stiff skis for inbounds and he got me the new Black Pearls - the best graduation gift! I got out on them once in late March before ski season was over. We decided to get a seasons pass to Stevens Pass for the 2017 - 2018 season. We got some early snow and got our first ski day in before Thanksgiving, but then the rain came followed by a high pressure system so snow was scarce. We still managed to get out 5 days even in early season conditions, although I skied on a lot of rocks. More snow finally came just before the holidays so we got one last day in at Stevens and I learned to cross country ski! It's the newest sport I'm adding to my list of hobbies and I'm looking forward to doing a lot more of it in 2018, in addition to more days on groomers at the resort.</p>

			<h4 class="statsTitle">Gym Climbing Stats</h4>
			<p>I unfroze my membership (thawed?) in March and got back into the gym a lot more regularly. I think Aaron was happy to have a steady climbing partner back too. It started with me trying to get my grip strength back. We led a bit early on and I felt like I had an amazing lead head! During the busy summer months with people visiting and trips, we didn't get to the gym much but during the fall we did and I started noticing improvements. I was able to do a few more 5.11's - it felt pretty good! I was even climbing so much I had to get my shoes resoled again!</p>

			<h4 class="statsTitle">Outdoor Climbing Stats</h4>
			<p>I was able to do a lot more climbing outside this year but still didn't get back to prior year levels. We got out several times in early spring, one trip to Vantage and many to Leavenworth. Although leading in the gym had been feeling great, leading outside was super scary. I struggled to lead low 5's again. We also had a fun day, mind you a very hot day, at Exit 38 climbing at Farside during Memorial Day weekend.</p>
			<p>Aaron really wanted to do something in the alpine but I was hesitant because of my lead head. A group of friends headed off to Washington Pass for fourth of July like past years so we joined them. Aaron being sensitive to my lead head, agreed to climb the south arete of SEWS and I led the entire thing. I felt great and it was nice to get out in the North Cascades, my favorite place!</p>
			<p>During Thanksgiving, since the ski resorts had closed due to the rain, we found a nice day at Vantage and got one more day in. We mostly climbed at the Feathers - North Side and I had a blast leading a bunch of easy sport routes. I'll keep working on it but I think it'll take a while to get back to leading outside like I used it. In the mean time I'm happy to follow Aaron up things!</p>

			<!--Hiking Stats-->
			<h4 class="statsTitle">Hiking Stats</h4>
			<p>My big trip for the year was to the Grand Canyon. My work sponsored four trips to encourage team bonding. Headquarters is also in Arizona so it's more of a local trip for a lot of people. I was selected to go on the upper canyon trip, so I rafted through the upper canyon and then hiked up from the river to the south rim via the Bright Angel trail. Aaron also climbed Mount Rainier again this year with Niki, her uncle, and a coworker so we both had some trips to train for. Aaron's climb was towards the end of July and my trip was early August so they aligned fairly well.</p>
			<p>As soon as I was done with school we started getting out for hikes. Assuming my limitations we started with hikes under 2000' gain, then up to 2500' gain, then 3000' gain, then 3800', and finally over 4500'. Aaron knew he needed to train with weight so after the first few hikes, he started carrying lots of water. I had to carry my gear out of the canyon as well. The rafting company provided some but I figured I'd still have about 22 or 23lbs to carry so I also started carrying a bit of extra training water.</p>
			<p>The hikes ranged from ones I've done a few times to some new ones, both along I-90, out in central Washington, and up in the North Cascades. I finally hiked up Swakane Peak near Wenatchee with Niki and Gloria. That was a fun one where we got to do some navigation. Aaron and I did some training hikes along I-90 up Mount Washington and Granite Mountain, old hikes to me but new to him. We were caught a bit off guard with how much snow was still up on Granite too. We did some easier hikes with friends and their kids too which was fun, a good reason to do those. In addition to climbing SEWS over fourth of July we also hiked to Easy Pass, a new hike for both of us. The creek crossings were a bit crazy but we got a few good glissades down from the top.</p>
			<p>My final training hike would be during Aaron's Rainier climb. The plan was for me to hike up to Camp Muir, 4700' gain, with 26 lbs on my back which included 4 liters of water. This way I'd be doing more than the Grand Canyon hike in terms of elevation gain and pack weight, in a shorter distance and at a much higher elevation. I figured if I could do that, I'd have no problem with the Grand Canyon - assuming I could handle the heat. I made record time up to Camp Muir, probably feeling the best I ever had on that hike. I slept in the parking lot at Paradise the night before so I think that really helped. Also there were excellent steps in the firm snow from all of the guided groups. They had a successful climb on the DC route, I think were happy to have my water so they didn't have to spend time melting snow, and I even carried some gear down. </p>
			<p>The Grand Canyon hike went fine but not without its struggles in the heat. It took me about 6 hours to do the hike, where as if it were in Washington I think it would have been 4 hours. However, it was an amazing experience and the views of the canyon never get old! In the fall we did a few hikes to lakes, Aaron's first backpacking trip ever and my first overnight in years. We went with his soccer team to Rachel Lake. We also hiked to Merritt Lake along highway 2 with his parents. It was a great hike and I'm looking forward to exploring more hikes out there in the coming years.</p>
