			<h1>Granite Mountain 6.11.17</h1>
			<p>
			The forecast looked decent and I wanted to go hiking. Aaron decided he should get some training in too. I suggested Granite Mountain, a new I-90 peak for him. I told him the stats and he thought it sounded good. We slept in and didn't get going until almost 10, starting on the trail about 11am. The parking lot was full with many cars parked down the road so we took up the end along the road and got ready. Aaron had brought about 30lbs of water with him while I decided to bring an extra 2 liters, or about 4.5lbs.

			The first 1.2 miles heads through the forest until meeting the fork - left to Pratt and right to Granite. We stopped here for a quick break and then headed right. The trail was nice through the trees - not overly rocky and in the shade. After taking the fork the trail got a bit steeper and I was feeling it, or rather I wasn't feeling very energetic. I ended up taking several little breaks along the way and finally ate a few shotbloks even though I didn't feel hungry.

			We crossed the first avalanche gully and then switchbacked in the trees a bit more before crossing the second, and eventually the third. The avalanche gullies of course don't have the tall trees and shade so it was a bit warm and dusty, but they did provide the first of the views of the peaks south across I-90. Finally we were doing the long traverse across the meadow, above the treeline, and had great views of the mountains to the south.

			There were several people along the trail and unfortunately many didn't adhere to the common courtesy of yielding to the uphill hikers. This was disappointing as usually people along the trail are so friendly - and I must say not everyone did that but several groups did. I finished off the last half of a pack of shotbloks as we started up the few switchbacks in the meadow, maybe starting to feel a bit better. We soon hit the first patches of snow just below 5000' I think. Some hikers had told us about snow earlier so it wasn't a complete surprise. After weeks of checking trip reports and bringing microspikes we did neither for this hike. I had a trekking pole and my hiking shoes while Aaron was in his shorts and hiking boots. We hit the large snowfield on the ridge and started up. I was able to follow Aaron's steps to start but soon lost them and wandered up the best steps I could find.

			When we made it to the crest of that, we had a good view up the rest of the ridge. There was a narrow snow bootpack inbetween groups of boulders. There were several groups heading up and down so we figured it would be slow going. Aaron suggested heading off the ridge through the snow and heading up to the ridge crest farther west, but I worked hard for the elevation I had gained and didn't want to lose even a little bit. Up the ridge we went with another group. It was a bit slick as the boot track was well traveled and some hikers had boot-skied down destroying any steps that had been made. We alternated between hiking on the snow and scrambling over the boulders, with the transitions always being the most nerve racking for the chance of punching through the snow and twisting an ankle in the boulders beneath.

			Before too long we arrived at the lookout tower at the top, yes! The tower wasn't open so Aaron didn't get to check it out. As we approached he figured out this was the third lookout I had taken him too - Green Mountain and Hidden Lake were the other two. There were several groups taking a well deserved break among the boulders below the tower. The clouds were a bit low but we still had great views of all the nearby mountains. As we headed up the ridge we spotted the Tooth, Guye Peak, Red Mountain, and Mount Thompson - all peaks we had climbed together in the past. After some snacks and the glorious pouring out of training water, we headed down. Our lighter packs, yes even my 4.5lb lighter pack, felt wonderful.

			I told Aaron I'd be super slow heading down the bootpack without my microspikes, so he suggested we plunge step down the back of the ridge and follow the natural contours to the notch near the trail. He found a spot along the ridge and started down, letting me know the snow was good for plunge stepping. The first 20 feet were a bit hard (probably wind scoured) but below that it was very pleasant. Of course I didn't have gaiters so I got some good shoe fulls of snow, but I moved a lot faster than I would have if I stayed on the ridge - Aaron definitely made the right route decision for us. On the way I even happened to find a car key in the snow (spoiler alert we even found the car it belonged to in the parking lot!).

			After quick work of the snow slopes we were back on the trail. The trail just below the snowpack was a bit wet from all the melt, so as we got a little farther down we took a break in a dry spot so I could put my patellar bands on. From there on out it was steady progress to the car. It took us about 3 hours to hike up and an hour and fourty minutes to get back down. Despite feeling not great with my performance for the middle of the hike, it was still a good day to get out, get Aaron a new peak, and enjoy some beautiful views of the mountains.
