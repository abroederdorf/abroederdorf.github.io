			<h1>Heather Lake 5.27.17</h1>
			
			<p>
			I’ve been taking mental notes of hikes I think might be good with little ones and Saturday presented a great opportunity to go on one. We picked out Heather Lake, a popular but shorter trail that we hadn’t done before off of the Mountain Loop highway. Both Luna and Roman were up for the challenge, i.e. sleeping in their carriers and being trail warriors. We figured it’d be busy so we wanted to get there early, but I’m learning baby schedules are ever changing so we decided to try and leave Seattle about 7:30a. Recent trip reports mentioned a bit of snow at the lake, but it sounded like the trail was mostly snow free.

			By the time we arrived at the trailhead all of the normal parking spots were taken so we parked just a little ways down the road. Ben, Chris, and Roman showed up just a few minutes after we arrived. Everyone fed their respective babies, got sunscreen on, and we hit the trail. Sara registered our party of nine - 6 adults, 2 babies, and 1 dog. The trail was fun as it wound it’s way through the trees. There were several very large stumps left from past logging activity that now act as nurse logs/stumps for new trees to grow out of. There were a couple of stream crossings but everyone carrying babies made it across safely (and those of us without those adult responsibilities).

			The temperatures were comfortable as we hiked up through the shade of the trees. There was lots of green and tons of tree roots. For as popular as the trail is, it was a bit more on the wild side than I expected. Rocks to step up on, lots of roots - not a nice wide dirt trail.

			The trail was busy but overall not too bad. The group was pretty excited that we only got passed by one pair despite have the wee little ones along. Before long we hit the snow, a good sign that we were almost at the lake.

			There was a decent boot pack through the snow although a few members found some holes. We headed right around the lake and found a nice little snow free area with a couple logs to sit on in the shade. Everyone ate and relaxed a little. Aaron tried bouldering but his trail runners weren’t quite the right footwear. The lake was very calm and there were several large waterfalls on the ridgeline above it. As I warmed up in the sun on the shore I even got to enjoy a chorus of ribbets from two nearby little frogs.

			Once everyone was fed and happy, we hiked down. Lots of people were still heading up and they commented a lot on Aida (deer hound dog) and the little babies - apparently everyone really likes baby sunglasses I learned. On the way home we stopped at the BBQ Bucket in Granite Falls. The food was delicious and I’m now plotting on how to hike up there more so I can eat all the BBQ.
