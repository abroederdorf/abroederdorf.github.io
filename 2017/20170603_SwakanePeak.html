			<h1>Swakane Peak 6.3.17</h1>
			<p>
			The ICC was short on instructors for Alpine 1 so Aaron volunteered. He got assigned to climb NBC on Colchuck and the team decided to go on Saturday. He suggested I head out to Leavenworth with him and hike something on my own on Saturday, and then we could crag on Sunday. That seemed like a decent plan. Niki and Gloria decided heading out to Leavenworth sounded good so I got a couple of hiking buddies for Saturday. Hiking buddies meant I could find a more fun hike since wouldn’t be by myself so I was excited. I had found Swakane Peak a couple years ago and thought it looked like an interesting hike. I just never quite found the opportunity to go do it, so that’s what I picked. Luckily Niki and Gloria were game for it too.
			</p>

			We slept in a bit at camp and grabbed some food in Leavenworth on the way to Wenatchee. We followed the directions to the trailhead from the WTA description and had no issues finding it. The road was definitely rough, luckily Niki expertly navigated the mini through it. We parked near the gate and got ready, starting about 11am. Luckily the weekend was a fair bit cooler than the previous. Almost all of the trip reports I had found mentioned hiking the road until the fourth switchback and then heading up the ridge rather than continuing along the road. That approach looked to be about 7.5 miles round trip rather than 11+ miles if we stayed on the road, so we opted for the direct route. I had printed a map with a couple lines of beta to reference.

			The trail/road was pretty good. Lots of plants growing up and a bit of sand which wasn’t our favorite. We got some good views of the valley we drove through to get to the trailhead as we started gaining elevation. We kept track of the switchbacks and after the fourth one we kept an eye on the ridge for when to depart. We probably went a bit farther than we needed before heading up, but it still worked fine. We just had to head up a bit steeper terrain to reach the top of the ridge before continuing up. We had gone about 2 miles on the road and gained just over 1000’ before heading up the ridge.

			We hiked through lots of grasses and kept an eye out for critters - especially rattlesnakes. We didn’t find any (luckily) but we did see a few lizards and several birds. As we reached crests in the ridge we’d stop to plot our next line. It was actually kind of fun navigating ourselves rather than following a trail the whole way. I’d get the altitude from my GPS and then we’d check the map and plan. We hiked past several burnt trees but overall the mountain didn’t have a lot of trees - burnt or alive. There were tons of flowers too which were really pretty. It felt a little like the sound of music as we spotted some snow capped peaks in the distance.

			We reached the summit of Point 3923 and found the old overgrown road. We followed that to the saddle below Swakane Peak (Point 4297) and rejoined the trail/road. We walked up it maybe a hundred feet or so until we found a good place to head up and started hiking up the southeast ridge of Swakane Peak - we again opted for the most direct route.

			There was a faint boot pack up the lower portion, which was easier to follow on the way down. About half way up we hit the larger boulders and picked our own adventure through those, making sure to trend up the ridge. It was a fun and not overly difficult mini scramble.

			We soon reached the top and each picked out a rock to rest on. We could see some of the sawtooth range to the north, the plateau to the east, the Columbia River and city of Wenatchee to the south, and a few mountains to the west.

			After enjoying the views and some food, we headed down the way we came up. We followed the road on Point 3923 and then started heading down the ridge. We started heading down a bit too steeply and had to correct a bit. I kept an eye on my GPS to keep us following our track up within reason. We had good views of Wenatchee on the way down and started picking out familiar landmarks.

			I had spotted a tree along the trail on the way up that I thought would be a good spot to gain the ridge, so instead of following our track down we aimed for that. The terrain was a bit less steep but the grass was dense.

			We popped out on the trail/road by the tree and headed down, glad to be back on the trail. The last two miles and four switchbacks didn’t seem never ending, which was good, but I was happy to see the gate at the trailhead. It was a warm day but luckily not unbearably hot. It was a fun hike and certainly a good option for earlier in the season when the rest of the mountains are still socked it. Also, we somehow lucked out and had the trail to ourselves the entire day - I don’t think that’s ever happened to me before.
