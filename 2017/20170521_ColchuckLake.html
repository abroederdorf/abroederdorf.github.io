			<h1>Colchuck Lake 5.21.17</h1>
			
			<p>
			We were heading out towards Leavenworth so we were trying to pick a hike out there within by current fitness level. We had thought about doing a few laps at Stevens Pass but the forecast at the pass was for a high in the mid 60’s. That snow didn’t sound fun for skiing. There are a bunch of hikes along highway 2 but most of the forest service roads are still snowed in so we couldn’t get to the trailhead. I checked the forest service website and saw that the road to the Stuart Lake trailhead had just opened, so we settled on a hike to Colchuck Lake. It sounded like the trail was mostly still covered in snow from a recent trip report so we all brought microspikes.

			The road seems in especially rough condition this year so we bounced our way up it. There were lots of cars at the parking lot but we still found one of the last few spots around the perimeter. The pit toilet was even open and stocked with toilet paper! I was still getting over my cold and was really congested, so I brought a snot rag (i.e. handkerchief) as snot rockets were not pretty. There were a few others that arrived at the trailhead at the same time we did, otherwise the trail in was pretty quiet to start. The first little bit was dirt with some big mud pits to dance around/through. We hit snow not too long after but it was patchy. There was a decent boot track across it usually.

			We made it to the first bridge crossing without too much issue. We stopped quick on the other side so I could take a short break and eat some food. We continued on after I made my request to take another quick break at the trail split between Colchuck and Stuart lakes. This next section was more snow than dirt, although every so often we’d get to take a few steps on dirt. We still hiked along in our boots since it was still a little bit of a mixture. We hit the trail split but Aaron suggested we stop along the creek instead. Since it’s only a couple minutes farther we trudged along. The creek was running pretty good. We crossed the bridge and picked our way through the boulders along the water to find a nice little area to sit. Aaron and I put sunscreen on as we hadn’t at the car and ate some food.

			During the second half of the hike we started seeing more people, both going up and coming down. The trail was almost all snow now. We got to another water crossing. Usually I walk across a downed log for this one but the log was covered in snow so we had to hop across on rocks instead. I have a 50/50 chance of stepping in the water rock hopping but I fared ok. We happened to meet some people here and they told us it was pretty much snow the rest of the way, so we stopped and put our microspikes on. The bootpack we were following got a bit off from the summer trail and we went a little high. It was disheartening to lose elevation and had tired me out, but we followed the track down to get back on the right path. There were a few little areas of dirt as we started back up, but it was mostly snow. Although several holes were forming as it crossed over some running water on the trail. We even saw a goat!

			The last quarter of the hike we got behind more people. I was surprised to see so many hikers in running shoes without any trekking poles. I was feeling pretty tired and worn out, as well as hungry, so I was keeping an eye on the GPS to see how close we were to the lake. Finally we made it, and didn’t hike too far along it before we found some nice rock to sit on. It was a warm day but cool at the lake so we put our thin jackets on. There were some very bold chipmunks looking for food that we had to keep an eye on. Lots of different groups were around the lake and we saw a few specks moving down Asgaard Pass. The lake was mostly snow covered although a little melty around the edges. After a nice break and some food, we decided to pack up and head down.

			We cut a little off of the trail on the way down since we had a better idea of where we were, which was nice. I slipped and fell on a downed tree which slowed me down for a while (I also got to go home with a very nice bruise). We kept our microspikes on until the rock hopping creek crossing. Aaron kept his on but Niki and I took ours off, I didn’t trust my 50/50 abilities with them on. It’s nice how fast they are to take on and off though, so we put them back on once across. We passed several groups on the way down. Most of them had running shoes on so I think we were just getting better purchase in the snow so we could go faster.

			When we got down to the second bridge crossing we noticed the creek was flowing even higher than earlier and where we had sat for the quick break was now covered in water. We took our microspikes off here and hiked the rest of the trail down in boots. The last mile or so always seems never ending but we finally made it to the trailhead. We of course stopped for sausages in town at Munchen Haus before heading home. Colchuck Lake with Dragontail and Colchuck looming overhead is always a pretty place to be, so it was a good hike to an old favorite.
