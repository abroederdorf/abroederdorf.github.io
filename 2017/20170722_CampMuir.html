			<h1>Camp Muir 7.22.17</h1>
			<p>
			Aaron, Niki, Niki’s uncle Gary, and Aaron’s coworker Steve were planning to climb Rainier via the DC route over three days. They got permits for Thurs - Sat at Camp Muir. I didn’t want to go and ruin their summit chances (given my general issues with altitude) but a hike to Camp Muir sounded intriguing. I’m headed to the Grand Canyon courtesy of work in a couple weeks and have to do the hike out via the Bright Angel trail which is about 9.5 miles and 4300’ of gain. That trip has been my goal as we’ve been getting out to hike this year and I try to get back in shape after my hiatus for school. Muir would be 4600’ in less than 5 miles, and at a higher elevation, so I figured it’d be a good test for me to see if I am ready for my Grand Canyon adventure. Since Saturday would be the crew’s summit day, I planned to lug up an extra 4 liters of water for them - to be nice and to act as my training weight. I’m guessing my pack will weigh about 22 lbs coming out of the canyon so my pack up to Muir with the extra water, plus my own two liters, and a few other essentials got me to 26 lbs. Again, I wanted to aim for more than I’d need on my canyon trip so I know I’d be good. Aaron was thinking they’d get back to camp around noon so I wanted to get up there before then. I planned to sleep in my car in the parking lot the night before and get an early start on Saturday. I know I slow down around 8500’ so I was trying to give myself about 5.5 hours to get up to camp, assuming 1000’/hour up to 8500’ and then a bit slower.
			</p>
			<p>
			I left Seattle about 7:15p Friday night. I stopped for some dinner along the way and got to the Paradise overnight/trailhead parking lot about 10:15p. I had actually driven Niki’s car down so that they could use the Crosstrek plus box for the four of them, so I made a loop through the parking lot looking for my car. I didn’t see it (granted it was dark), so I drove through again clicking my lock button so my car would light up. I finally found it and found a parking spot just across the way. I carried my stuff to my car, put down the backseat, and laid diagonal across it and the trunk. I could just completely lay out. I got ready for bed and set my alarm for 5:15a. I actually slept decently well and snoozed a few times in the morning. Finally I woke up at 5:30a and started getting ready. I ate some applesauce for breakfast and then slathered myself in sunscreen. I drove the car to the main Paradise lot but I noticed a sign that said 2 hour parking, so I drove back to the other lot and parked again. I grabbed my stuff and walked up to the visitor center and used the restroom in the tunnel before heading out. There were a few people around the parking lot but overall it was pretty quiet. I hit the trail at 6:30a.

			I know in the past I’ve gassed myself right out of Paradise as the trails are surprisingly steep, so I took my time heading up the paved trails. My plan was to follow the Skyline Trail to Panorama Point and then head up the Muir Snowfield from there. Not too far into my trip I stopped on the trail as I watched a deer eat just off of it. Soon another deer joined the first so I took a few pictures until a couple of other hikers came up and decided they didn’t want to stop for the deer and scared them off.

			There were probably four or five other groups also heading up Skyline nearby. When we hit the fork in the trail all of them took the Glacier Vista trail while I stuck to Skyline. there was one little patch of snow at the fork, but then I didn’t hit more snow for a little bit. I caught up to a couple other groups ahead of me. I was trying to keep a nice pace as to not burn myself out.

			A little below Pan face there were more patches of snow, with well worn boot packs to follow. On a switchback we had to cross what looked like melted out glissade chutes, and I spotted my second Marmot of the morning. If you want to see a lot of wildlife at Paradise, apparently 6:30a is the time to go.

			At the corner above that the trail sign pointed me a different way to head to Pebble Creek without having to pass through Panorama Point, so I took it. I think a lot of the groups out that morning were stopping around there because soon I had the place mostly to myself.

			Up just past Pebble Creek the snow started for almost the entire way. There was a good boot pack to follow and luckily the snow was fairly hard - not icy but stiff so I didn’t waste a lot of energy hiking up in the snow. The views were pretty decent of the Tatoosh range plus the mountains to the south. There was a small cloud layer but it dissipated as I gained elevation. About 7500’ I caught up to another gentleman also heading to Camp Muir. His daughter and her climbing group were up there as well with a summit bid that morning. We exchanged a few words and I kept on plodding upward. I was impressed that there was such a distinct boot pack up and it even had little steps. Usually it seems to be a giant field of steps and I waste time and energy trying to follow the best path up. I kept a close eye on my GPS, happy to see the elevation going up. All progress, no matter how small, was motivation for me to continue.

			At 2 hours I had gained 2400’ and at 3 hours I had gained 3500’ and was just shy of 9000’. I was pretty proud of my progress but around 8700/8800’ I started to feel myself slow down a little. I had thought about taking a break at 8000’ and then 8500’ but I was still feeling good at both of those milestones so I kept going. Finally I stopped at 9000’, where there was a big group of rocks just below Moon Rocks. In fact, I actually got to walk across some dirt/rocks instead of snow. It was maybe 20 - 30’ of it, but it was the only none snow travel between about 7200’ - 10050’. I sat on the rocks and ate a bit more food. I had felt my stomach off and on, but luckily nothing too bad. I think sleeping at the trailhead the night before did wonders for helping me acclimate. After 10 minutes I hit the trail again. I don’t know if it’s good I knew what to expect or not, but I knew that last 1000’ of gain was going to be slow and hard work.

			I kept trudging up. I knew I’d get a glimpse of Camp Muir soon and it would seem so close while in reality it’s not. I would check behind me every so often to look at the mountains and the hikers behind me. There were a few ants marching up the mountain but not as many people as I expected yet. I had had one guy pass me but otherwise no one else, which was surprising. Looking out at the mountains I had a good view of Mount Adams, Mount Hood, and Mount St Helens. I even spotted Mount Jefferson way in the distance. Finally I spotted the buildings at camp which acted as a pick me up. I still had 500’ to go and the going was slow, but I was making it.

			In the last 200 - 300’ a few groups of climbers appeared - I’m not sure where they came from. They all passed me before camp as I was moving really slow. Finally I crested the ridge 4 hours and 20 minutes after I started. I did way better than I expected! I said bye to the other lone hiker I had talked a bit with, and set out to find Aaron’s tents.

			It only took me a few minutes before finding Gary. He told me about what he had heard from the other teams that had come down already, either turning around early that morning or those that had summited the day prior. Most groups were taking about 13 hours round trip from camp, and the route sounded like it dropped 600’ above the cleaver - gross! We chatted about hiking and climbing while watching little ants come down from the summit. Every time there was a group of three we’d stare intently trying to figure out if it was our crew or not. The crew rolled into camp about 12:30p and rightfully rested for a bit before breaking down camp and finishing the hike to the cars. After offloading my 10 pounds of water, I volunteered to carry their rope down and I grabbed a few tent parts too.

			About 2:30p we left Camp Muir. The summit crew wanted to glissade everything they could so I made sure to put my rain pants on before we left. I wasn’t sure we’d get that much glissading as I only saw a couple of short chutes on the way up. We hiked down a bit before finding the first chute. After that we did a great job of finding more glissade chutes, and eventually making our own. We extended probably a 200’ chute into about 700’, it was awesome!

			My rain pants really helped facilitate some good glissading so it was well worth the effort to bring them with me. In total I think we were able to drop about 2500’ of the 4700’ glissading, which was really nice! When we hit the dirt near pebble creek I changed out of my rain pants and gaiters while many of the crew changed out of their mountaineering boots into shoes.

			The last 1500’ or so down was more annoying than I hoped, with clueless tourists spread all over the trails. Apparently people with large packs are more agile than tourists with cameras so the climbers should move out of the way. Finally we picked our way down through everyone and made it back to the parking lot. I had beers stashed in the car that the climbing crew appreciated while we all changed into glorious, dry cotton clothing. Overall a beautiful day in the mountains. The last time I had gone to Camp Muir was in 2012 and with an overnight pack - who knew the hike could be so enjoyable!
