			<h1>Eightmile Lake 6.17.17</h1>
			<p>
			It was couples retreat weekend! We decided to head to Leavenworth to camp, hike, and climb. There were three couples total, so half the group left Seattle mid afternoon on Friday to go secure a campsite while the other half left during the Friday commute. Aaron had planned to find a campsite at Upper Johnny Creek but as his car would find out, almost all of the campsites along Icicle Creek road were taken. They eventually ventured onto the gravel portion of the road and after driving almost 17 miles down Icicle Creek, got one of the last two camp sites at Rock Island campground. All six of us regrouped in town at about 8:30p to grab some dinner and hear about the adventures of the weekend thus far. After that we stopped by Safeway to pick up breakfast and dinner food for the rest of the weekend and ventured back down Icicle Creek to our campsite. The gravel road was full of potholes so we tried to minimize how often we had to drive it.

			Saturday morning we woke up a bit after 8a. Aaron made pancakes for the group and after getting everything cleaned up, we hit the bumpy road a little after 10a. Our first objective of the day was a hike to Eightmile Lake. I had never done it and thought this might be a great opportunity. We got to enjoy a few miles of paved road before heading up NF-7601, another bumpy gravel road. The trailhead was packed by time we arrived so we found a spot along the road to park. We got ready and hit the trail about 11:15a. The first part of the trail gains a decent amount of elevation and is probably the steepest section. We hiked up through a lot of green, bordering on an overgrown trail, with lots of flowers. After that we crossed a few creeks and started getting out of the overgrown green and into the fire scarred terrain.

			I believe there was a wild fire in the area back in 2012, and there are many charred remnants. Some of the burnt trees did not look like they should still be standing. The trail meanders through the valley to the lake. The elevation gain is really moderate and there aren’t many switchbacks which is kind of nice. There was luckily only one part of the trail where the mosquitos were bad. The trail was busy, as indicated by the overflowing trailhead. We made it to Little Eightmile lake and took about a minute break, just long enough for me to get a couple pictures. Beyond that we started entering an area with lots of boulders with a more orangeish color. It was really interesting. A little over a half mile from there we started up the last few switchbacks up a tiny ridge before the lake itself.

			The east end of the lake was surrounded by trees so we continued on a bit, until we hit a bit boulder field. Aaron found a large boulder there for the whole group to sit on so we made our way across and climbed up it. The view of Eightmile Lake from here was fantastic with the surrounding mountains as a backdrop. There was one guy fishing and several other groups in and amongst the boulders. We even spotted a couple of marmots.

			We made quick time back down the trail. It took us about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get to the lake and about 1 hour and 20 minutes to get back to the trailhead. There were still plenty of groups heading up as we came down. When we got back to the cars we grabbed our food for lunch and enjoyed a nice picnic lunch on the table at the trailhead. We used the amenities well! After lunch we drove back down the bumpy road and drove down Icicle Creek to Barney’s Rubble and Bruce’s Boulder for a little afternoon dragging.
