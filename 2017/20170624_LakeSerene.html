			<h1>Lake Serene 6.24.17</h1>
			<p>
			The forecast was calling for high temperatures over the weekend. I had plans on Sunday but was looking for a hike on Saturday. Robin was planning a hike to Lake Serene to help celebrate Rory’s first birthday and was nice enough to let me tag along. Sara, Matt, and Luna picked me up a little after 7am so we could grab breakfast at the Sultan Bakery before meeting everyone at the trailhead at 9a. We got to the trailhead around 8:45a and it was packed. The upper lot and lower lot were full so we found a little space along the gravel road to park and take the little connector trail up to the main lot. Apparently the heat didn’t deter most of Seattle from coming out for a hike.

			We started around 9:30a and our group consisted of 8 adults, 4 children, and 1 dog. The first couple miles have a pretty easy gain. Luckily the trail is mostly tree covered so it didn’t feel as hot as I was expecting. That was probably why there were so many people there, it was a good hike on a hot day. A little ways in the wide road-trail disappears and there is a much more narrow trail that snakes through overgrown green. I was surprised how narrow the trail was given how busy it is. There are a few little ups and down and the trail widens a bit again once we were more in the trees. Before too long we were heading down the first of many staircases, I’m thinking thanks to many WTA volunteers over the years. I had done this hike once before in 2009 and don’t remember nearly as many stairs from that time.

			We passed the fork to Bridal Veil Falls, electing to continue onto the lake. There were lots of babies who would soon need to eat so we kept on trucking. We did take a break  by the little falls along the trail. There were a ton of people stopped there as well. With a slight breeze and the water I actually felt a little cool.

			After everyone got a few snacks we hit the trail again. Soon we started up the steep switchbacks. I think we had gained about 600’ of the 2000’ at the falls and I don’t think we had much more than a mile to the lake so the going was steep and challenging. This is the section with all of the nicely constructed stairs too.

			The final traverse before the lake took longer than I expected. I thought we were there at ever slight bend but there was always more trail. The trees open up just before the lake though and offers a great view of the mountains north across highway 2.

			Finally we made it to the lake and stopped before the bridge where there were several downed trees to sit on in some shade. Everyone ate and we sang happy birthday to Rory and enjoyed the pink frosted cupcakes we had helped carry up. There were lots of people at the lake and a few that went for a swim.

			After everyone was fed the kids were ready to go home so we took off down the trail. There were still lots of people heading up as we went down and the trail certainly felt a lot longer on the way out. Finally we made it back to the trailhead and could head home. A fun day in the mountains with friends, enjoying an old hike once again.
