			<h1>Margaret's Way 3.25.17</h1>
			<p>
			I’m done with school! And in attempt to start getting back into shape, we went for a hike Saturday afternoon. I had picked out Margaret’s Way trail on Squak mountain. It was listed as 5.5 miles and 1500’ of elevation gain, something that seemed appropriate for my current fitness level. Turns out it’s more like 6.6 miles with a bit more elevation from the ups and downs. As a bonus, it was a new trail I had never hiked and close to home. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Throughout the weekend, Saturday afternoon looked like the best chance at finding some non-rainy weather so we planned for then. Aaron, Niki, and I left Seattle a little after noon and arrived at the trailhead about 1pm. I was hoping some morning hikers would be clearing out and we did find a spot in the parking lot. There was maybe one other open spot, but not too many yet. It was sprinkling a little at the trailhead but it soon stopped. We hit the trail about 1:15p.

			I had read that the trail was well signed at it certainly is - we counted about 16 signs pointing out the trail for Margaret’s Way in the first mile and a half or so.

			On the way down we noticed that the first part of the trail goes through what looks to be an old campground. We saw water spigots and what appeared to be electrical hookups scattered around. There were signs pointing out trees as well. There were people on the trail but overall not busy - surprising for it’s proximity to Seattle. The trail was very muddy for the first part. Everything was so green and the signs along the trail were really nice. The views were a bit cloudy but it was good to get out - and we avoided the rain!

			We walked through various groups of trees, including cedar and poplar. Once we hit the switchback section, the trail dried out more and we made steady progress up. The trail map says 2.76 miles along Margaret’s Way to the trail junction at the top, but it’s more like 3.3 miles according to the GPS. The sign for Debbie’s Lookout indicated 0.3 miles so we decided to head out there even though we figured we wouldn’t get the view of Mount Rainier I had read about.

			We made it to the viewpoint about 1.5 hours after starting. There were a few groups of people there already and there was even a bench to sit on. I took a couple of pictures and we enjoyed some snacks, including some chardonnay Niki brought up. It was a bit chilly though so we got going after about 15 minutes to head back down to the car.

			It took us about an hour to get back to the car, and as I mentioned, we noticed the campground on the way down. Overall it was great to get out and a fun little hike I’ll have to keep in mind for future outings.
