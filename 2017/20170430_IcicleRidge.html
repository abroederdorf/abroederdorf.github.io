			<h1>Icicle Ridge 4.30.17</h1>
			<p>
			It was suppose to be pretty windy on Sunday. Aaron suggested doing a shorter hike up Icicle Ridge, which sounded good to me. We had camp packed up about 8:40a and drove down Icicle Creek to the little trailhead. We parked close to the trailhead. There were a few other cars but not many yet. We hit the trail a little after 9a. It was sunny with a lot of blue sky showing, a gorgeous day to be out. The hillside has trees here and there which allows for views of the icicle creek valley below. There are lots of switchbacks up the hillside to the ridgeline which provided a few opportunities to see the first of the snowy peaks in the Enchantments too. We even came across a little stream that was flowing pretty well.

			I felt like I was struggling a bit but we kept making steady (I think) progress up. We met a few groups coming down but overall not too busy. There was a camera crew on the trail even, not sure what their project was about. I checked my GPS periodically, hoping to be close to the top - I needed the extra motivation. Finally we reached the ridge just over an hour from starting and about 1600’ in gain. Even though I felt like I was moving at snail’s pace and was participating in a strugglefest, it was a little uplifting to know I had done almost 1600’ in an hour.

			At the ridge we were met with high winds. We took a climber’s right and continued on the ridge to the end with the nice view of Tumwater Canyon and the town below. There was one guy sitting along the ridge reading, apparently not too bothered by the wind. When we reached our objective we instantly grabbed our jackets to try and get some protection from the wind. I took my ‘summit’ photos, including one of us, and then we decided to head back down. We were planning on getting lunch in town so we didn’t eat any summit snacks.

			There were more people just behind us on the ridge now and we met several groups on our way down. Apparently we beat a bit of the mid morning rush? After we dropped down far enough to escape the wind, we stopped quick to take our jackets off. The trail is well maintained but a bit narrow so we had to get creative when meeting groups to find places to step off the trail without destroying any of the vegetation. We found a few rocks or tree stumps, or sometimes just got over as far as we could and leaned to give them room. About two hours after starting we were back at the car and heading into town for some delicious sausages and a pretzel at Munchen Haus, followed by a milkshake on the way out of town at Heidleburger.
