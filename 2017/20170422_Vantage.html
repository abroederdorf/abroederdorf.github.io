			<h1>Vantage: Sunshine Area, 4.22.17</h1>
			<p>
			It’s that time of year again, the BOEALPS spring campout. I hadn’t been in a couple years so that was our weekend plan. This year they got the group site at the Wenatchee Confluence State Park, a new location. It also happened to be the last weekend of the season at Stevens. However, the forecast looked a little wet so we chased the sunshine and ended up at Vantage on Saturday, and then did a few climbs in Leavenworth on Sunday.
			</p>

			We left Seattle about 7:20a and made a food stop in North Bend. We arrived to a very crowded Vantage around 10a. The Feathers had huge groups of people so we continued on and found a spot along the road right next to the parking lot with the toilet. There were lots of people and tents there so we weren’t sure how many open routes we’d be able to find. We took two ropes, a set a quickdraws, and a rack. We decided to try Kotick Memorial Wall as it is sometimes less busy than the main Sunshine Wall area. Rod of God (5.8) was open so Aaron suggested I lead that, while he went around the corner to lead Oral Office (5.8).

			I thought Rod of God was a 5.5 so I geared up and started up the arete climb. The first part is getting on top of this ledge, then the first bolt is a few moves above this. As I started to make my first move from the ledge I backed down and took a minute to compose myself. I was nervous and I wanted to find some good hand holds before I was able to reach the first bolt. I went again and was fine, and continued up. I was slightly shaking the whole time but I made it to the top and set the anchor. Not the confidence inspiring climb I was hoping for, but it was done. I set the anchor off of the bolts rather than the chains as I usually do, but the one bolt was set really far back from the lip. After lowering with horrible rope drag and knowing the rope was rubbing over that edge, I sent Gloria up with another sling to try and extend the anchor a bit. It still didn’t reach so I went back up and ended up setting one side of the anchor off the chains so that the locking biner with the rope was over the edge. This made it much better to belay off of.

			Next I headed over to Oral Office and climbed the 5.8 crack Aaron had led. Off of that same anchor I then also climbed Gurgling (5.7), another crack. I went back over to Rod of God and the easier chimney behind it, Carnival Ride (5.4), was almost open so we waited so I could lead that. I mostly stayed out on the corners with my left foot on holds on the Rod of God pillar, and my right on the other pillar. I was about a move too short for the top so I finally got myself in a chimney position so I could set the anchor.

			After that I went back over towards Oral Office where Aaron had set the rope down Heartbeat (5.9), an arete climb. To end the day we walked to the other end of Sunshine Wall to the Tilted Pilars area so I could get a trad lead in on Chapstick (5.6). It has lots of ledges with only a few somewhat trickier spots (i.e. no giant ledges). The crack peters out a ways below the anchor so I ran out the top, but otherwise it was good. The wind was really strong so after everyone had climbed it, Aaron cleaned the anchor. He threw the rope to rappel down but it went completely sideways, so he used the gunsling approach instead. We packed up, hiked up the gully, and back to the cars to head to Wenatchee and set up camp.
