			<h1>Easy Pass 7.2.17</h1>
			<p>
			For the second day of our WA Pass bash, I wanted to do a hike. There was a lot less snow than I was expecting so we decided not to do Whistler Mountain. I had seen that Easy Pass was 7 miles with 2900' gain so I thought that would work well. We woke up around 8a and packed up camp. There were two guys who had just gotten back to the trailhead when we pulled in so we asked them about conditions. They said there was snow but tracks to follow. We had brought our ice axes but didn't want to bring them if we didn't have to - the guys recommended we did so we followed their advice. I hadn't read much about the trail beforehand so we read the descriptions at the trailhead signs and got going just after 10a.
			</p>

			There was a boardwalk along the trail just after starting and a little ways down from that a nice, long log bridge crossed Granite Creek. The creek was flowing pretty well beneath us as we crossed. After that we started winding our way through the trees. There were a few more boardwalks in boggy areas - I was impressed by the amount of trail maintenance we encountered. There were a few mud pits on this trail as well, and one downed tree that was slightly problematic - we crawled under it on the way up and then walked across and jumped down on the way back.

			Just before exiting the cover of the forest we encountered our first crossing of Easy Pass creek. The water was running very high and I didn't like the options for crossing. There were rocks but they were mostly submerged. There were a few skinny trees that had water rushing nearby and looked very slick. Aaron suggested taking off our boots and walking across but the water seemed fairly high in places. We contemplated turning around at this point, but then I suggested we bushwhack up just a little farther - as we went it looked like others had also gone that way. There were more downed trees here, also thin but a little bit farther above the water. It also seemed a little narrower to get across. I went first and luckily there were some tree branches I used to help steady myself. I made it and Aaron soon followed. We bushwhacked a few feet back to the trail and continued on.

			We now entered the meadow and got our first good views of Easy Pass. We started encountering larger patches of snow now. We followed boot tracks for the most part and found the sections of trail that had melted out as we crossed the meadow to get to the bottom of pass. Aaron started heading up the far snow finger and yelled back down to me to ask if I saw a trail. I looked around and found one a little below me. Aaron didn't want to lose the elevation so he said he's bushwhack across to find the trail while I backtracked a little to the trail.

			The trail had running water and looked more like a stream. I had to cross a high running stream again, although this one was much smaller with rocks. I rolled up the bottom of my pants to keep them out of the water, but otherwise no difficulties. I followed the trail into the trees again, intermittently calling out for Aaron in case it helped him find his way towards the trail. I came across what I think is the official second crossing of Easy Pass Creek (the description said there were three). The water was again running high so I rolled up my pants and used the submerged rocks to get across without getting too wet. Just around the corner from there I found Aaron sitting along the trail, waiting for me.

			We continued following the trail up. It alternated between sections of dirt trail and snow covered trail. Finally we got to the base of a snowfield that looked to head all the way up to the pass. We could spot the trail up high, just below the pass and traced it back down the mountain a ways. Aaron asked if I'd rather take the snow or trail and I answered snow, as long as he was willing to kick me steps. We had 1000' to gain to the pass and he was of course up for the challenge, besides I think he preferred the snow as well. We took a break on a rock part way up and saw the dirt trail snaking alongside the snow - we were still happy to be heading more directly up the snow. There was a couple ahead of us with what looked to be large overnight packs. Aaron saw a pack left behind with an overnight permit so he decided to be a kind fellow hiker and bring it up. He didn't make it very far before the guy came boot glissading back to retrieve it but I think he was still appreciative of the effort.

			Finally we crested the last ridge where we could see the top of the pass. Aaron was up ahead and looking for a good spot for a break. We headed climbers right, past a national park boundary marker, and down the trail. We didn't go far, just enough to get a good view of all the mountains including Fisher Peak, Arriva Mountain, and Mesahchie Peak. Aaron had found a spot up on a hill hidden a bit from the wind so we headed up there to eat our summit snacks. Three hours after we left the car we started back down.

			There was a couple who were heading down while we were heading up and the guy made some nice glissade chutes, so we took advantage of them. I had stuck my mittens in so I put those on and grabbed my ice axe before starting the first of three glissades down. The snow was a bit icy but the glissade made quick work of the elevation.

			We passed another five people heading up the snowfield on our way down. Once we got to the bottom of the large snowfield we stowed our ice axes and continued down. We used the snow to our advantage to be more direct if there were switchbacks that crossed the same snow pack. Aaron even convinced me to cross a large choss section to reach the snow finger in the meadow to avoid more switchbacks and a creek crossing along the trail. It was a good, efficient decision.

			We continued across the snow and soon reached the last of them so I put away my little gaiters. Just a little more along the trail and we hit the major creek crossing again. We both made it across without any incident - yay! Glad to be passed that last large obstacle, we cruised down the dirt trail through the trees back to the car. It took just under an hour and a half to get back down to the car - not bad! We hopped back in the car excited to head to Cascadian Farm to get ice cream on the way home.

						<h5>GPS track went a little crazy up the gully so part of it was removed, resulting in the two tracks. The first is most of the ascent, the second is the remaining ascent and all of the descent.
