			<h1>Leavenworth Cragging 6.17.17</h1>
			<p>
			It was Rachel and Brandon’s first time climbing outside so we decided to head to Barney’s Rubble and Bruce’s Boulder to find some easier routes. There was a group with a couple of ropes down at Barney’s Rubble so we decided to start at Bruce’s Boulder. Our first route was the 5.5 slab at Bruce’s Boulder - which happened to be my very first outdoor rock climb as well. I went up first to talk about some of the footwork they should try to use, then everyone else took a turn climbing. The slab is certainly not beginner friendly but it did force them to trust their shoes a bit and everyone did great. Next Aaron moved the rope over to another climb he thought was a 5.9. I thought the 5.9 was on the corner and that was a 5.10-something. After working his way through the first moves we all realized it was certainly not a 5.9. Luckily another climbing pair close by had a book and informed us it was the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/510d-slabcrack/111973615">5.10d</a>. Aaron finally figured out how to get up to the crack, which is listed as 5.8, and had no issues going up from there.

			None of us wanted to try the route after watching Aaron so we directed the rope to the 5.9 on the corner. Wyeth went up first and figured out some of the more challenging parts. The start was tricky and involved a bit of stemming on the flake there. Then it’s  a few balance moves to get to the ramp. After walking up the ramp its a few more delicate balance moves across the face to get to the flake, which has a few finger pockets along it to make topping out not too bad. I had tried that route during my first outdoor outing and I don’t think I made it up, so it was nice after so many years to come back and climb it, and to climb it cleanly. It was a fun route. Brandon was going to try the route but I noticed that the 5.7 face at Barney’s Rubble was open so I grabbed the other rope and headed over there, thinking that might be a better second climb for both Brandon and Rachel.

			I set up the rope and rappelled down. Brandon climbed it first and did well, even handling the small crack section with relative ease. There was more trusting of the feet on the slab/face but both he and Rachel did well. Danielle climbed it and then I went last to drop the rope, clean the anchor, and hike back down. It was a short afternoon but we got a few fun climbs in and got to introduce a couple friends to outdoor climbing which is always fun - well, at least for me it is. After that we headed back to camp to cook some delicious dinner and hang out by the fire. Overall it was a fun and successful couples retreat!
