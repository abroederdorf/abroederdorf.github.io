			<h1>Shanahan Ridge 9.3.17</h1>
			<p>
			We were in Denver celebrating Danielle and her upcoming nuptials. On day 2, Sunday, we decided to go for a little hike outside of Boulder and explore that city. We got to the trailhead around 10:30am which consisted of a path leaving from a neighborhood. I had brought some sunscreen so after we suncreened up, we hit the trail. We had chosen to hike Shanghan Ridge, a local loop trail. The trail was very wide for most of it, which made passing the few people we encountered pretty easy.

			In the distance was South Boulder Peak. It had some large slabs of rock that looked like they made for good climbing. It was pretty far away but we didn’t notice any ant like people on it. The trail wound through meadows and trees, the trees were a nice reprieve from the sun. There were even some flowers blooming which was impressive since most everything looked pretty dry.

			I hiked toward the back but even so, I wasn’t feeling great. Lindsey and Alyssa hung back with me and took a few breaks which was much appreciated. I had stuffed a small piece of banana bread in my pack so I took that out and started to munch on it. I kept hiking and after a little bit I finally started to feel better - I was quite the struggle bus for a while there and still continued to have a headache for most of the afternoon. I thought I had eaten enough at breakfast and it wasn’t that long after but I guess I needed some more calories.

			We took a group picture near an overlook from the trees where we could spot a lake in the distance. We had 14 people hiking, it was a pretty sizable group. After that it was mostly down hill back to the start. It was very pleasant heading down and with the wide trail, allowed for some good conversations with others since we didn’t have to be all single file. We found the trail off to the left, leading back to the neighborhood and our cars. It was a short hike but fun to get out, if only I had felt a little better throughout.
