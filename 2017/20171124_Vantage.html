			<h1>Vantage 11.24.17</h1>
			<p>
			Normally the Thanksgiving break is when we get out for our first day or two of the ski season. This year the snow came early and we were actually able to get out skiing the week before the break - albeit in very early season conditions. Unfortunately the week of Thanksgiving brought record high temperatures and with it lots of rain to the region, so the snow quickly disappeared and most of the resorts closed. Without having a place to ski, we looked for some other activity to help burn off some turkey. For the first time ever during a Thanksgiving break, we went rock climbing outside.

			The forecast for Vantage called for mostly sun with a high in the low 50’s. The wind wasn’t even supposed to be too bad. We decided to head out Friday mid morning to let the rock warm up a little. We ended up leaving a little after 9a with a breakfast stop, pulling into the parking lot north of the Feathers about 11:30a. There were a few groups on the rock but still plenty of open routes so we grabbed our stuff and did the minute hike to the rock. I knew the cold rock would be an issue for my hands, we’ve climbed there very early spring and I’ve had issues. I don’t like numb hands when leading, I really like to feel what I’m holding onto. The south side with the sun was a lot busier as expected so we stayed on the colder north side, although that’s where the easier routes are too.

			To the right of the opening we found an open route, Mandatory Suicide (5.4). I got the honors of leading since I wanted to do some easy leads. I stayed in the corner for the most part, doing a little stemming. There were lots of jugs but my hands did get a bit numb part way up. I set the anchor and lowered down. Aaron decided he’d lead too so I belayed him up and he cleaned. Next I found an open route to the right a few columns, Get the Pever Fever (5.5). Again I got to lead it first, then Aaron led it after me. My hands felt better on that one and it was nice to get some easier leads in.

			Next the alcove area seemed open so we headed that way to do Updrafts to Heaven (5.5). Aaron was tired of having to clean the anchor so he led it first and I led it second. That is always a fun chimney. The walls are nice and close so it’s easier for me to actually chimney, compared to some of the other chimneys at Vantage that I stem more so. The Notch Route (5.6) opened up when I was done, so Aaron led up that one next. I remembered leading that route in March many years earlier and not liking when my hands got numb, so I was happy to have the draws Aaron left behind to make it even easier.

			Aaron had been eyeing The Uprising (5.8), the second route right of the opening on the north side. There were some large blank sections that didn’t look inviting to me so Aaron led it and I followed. It was certainly more challenging. Just below the top I headed right while everyone else who seemed to climb it went straight up. I got my hands on the nice jugs down lower on the right and walked my feet up/did a pull up. It worked for me, especially since I was on top rope. After I cleaned that anchor we decided to do one more route before eating lunch. Shake It Don’t Break It (5.5) had opened up right next to The Uprising so I got to lead that one first, since I had cleaned the last three routes. The first clip is high, just like on The Uprising, but fortunately the climbing is much easier on Shake It Don’t Break It. The route seemed a little less straight forward but still full of jugs so I made it up without much difficulty. There was a little puddle on the ledge at the top we avoided. Aaron led it after me, then we sat and ate our sandwiches.

			After lunch we drove over to the main parking lot so we could hike up and over to Kotick Memorial Wall by the Sunshine area. Lina, Mae, and a couple of other people were climbing over there so Aaron wanted to meet up with them. They were just about to clean the Crack in the Back (5.6) when we got there so both Aaron and I top roped it quickly. I won the race to get ready first so Aaron got the honors of cleaning that route. Next I top roped Rod of God (5.8). Certainly a lot less stressful than when I led it in April. That had been my first lead after a couple years off climbing and that first clip is a ways off the ground. Top roping it was a lot of fun.

			After that I belayed Mae as she led Carnival Ride (5.4), the chimney behind Rod of God. Logan cleaned it after her and then I top roped it. This is one where a lot of people prefer to climb it like a chimney, but I like to stay out on the jagged corners with all the jugs. After that we watched as the sunset lit up the clouds and then joined the line to get back up through the slot canyon. I wanted to make it down to the car before dark as I didn’t bring my headlamp. I wouldn’t have guessed we’d climb until dark, I guess we enjoyed getting a day out on the rock!
