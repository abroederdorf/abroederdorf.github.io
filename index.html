			<p>Welcome to my repository of trip reports. These trip reports are from my various adventures starting with my first hikes after moving to Seattle from the flatlands of the Midwest, continuing through completing a mountaineering course and learning to rock climb. These trip reports are my personal account of my adventures - both the good and the bad - but also generally include beta about the climb/hike. Happy trails!</p>
