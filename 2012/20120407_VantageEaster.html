			<h1>Vantage: Easter Edition 4.7 - 4.8.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			Easter was upon us which meant everyone had a weekend off from the BOEALPS climbing classes.  It was suggested to head to Vantage, and since I had a lot of fun with the girls Easter outing there last year, it sounded like a great plan to me.  Aaron e-mailed a bunch of people and before long we had a group of 12 heading out for at least part of the weekend.  We left our place just after 4PM Friday and made a pit stop in Cle Elum to grab food for the weekend as well as some DQ for dinner.  This would be our first weekend trying out the luxury car camping setup.  Needless to say the two sleeping pads alone took about a good quarter of the trunk space in the jeep.  Luckily Kevin was going to caravan out with us so we were able to put some stuff in his car too. About 10 miles from Vantage as we climbed up in the desert we watched the temperature drop outside – soon it was at 32 and it was sleeting outside, turning to snow.  Here we are heading out to the desert for a weekend of rock climbing and we’re driving out through a mini blizzard.</p>

			As we started down toward the Columbia river it turned back to rain.  We were within 10 mins of our destination so we started planning on long we’d hang out in the car to avoid the rain.  We pulled up to the northside of the Feathers which was already very busy with a couple large RVs taking up a bunch of space.  We decided to head to the southside where there were several campsites set up, but we found a nice big area near the trail up to the Feathers.  It was only lightly sprinkling so we decided to set up the tents before the rain we had just driven through reached us.  Aaron and I put up my new 4-person 3-season ALPs mountaineering tent and got the sleeping pads rolled out.  There was just enough room with the two sleeping pads to put our bags inside with us as well.  Aaron hung his lantern from the gear loft and our sweet setup was complete.  The rain seemed to be holding off so we layered up and the PBR was broken out.  Slowly the rest of the crew filed in – Luke and Alyssa, Devin and Danika.  After a bit we retired for the night.  I had brought everything I owned to sleep in and I was very glad for that as the temperatures were much lower than any of us expected.  I had the 4” sleeping pad, 10 degree sleeping bag, 20 degree sleeping bag liner, down booties, long underwear, and my giant puffy on and was none too toasty.</p>
			<p>
			I woke up to frost covering everything in the morning.  I quickly grabbed the plastic Easter eggs I had filled with chocolate and had Aaron have the group turn away from the hillside.  They all thought I wanted a little privacy but really I was just hurriedly trying to hide 40 brightly colored little plastic eggs.  Once we woke Luke up, they all ran for the hillside to find their allotted five eggs. Most came running down with eggs held above their head, I think everyone had a good time.</p>

			Soon Robert, Rose, and Wendy arrived.  We ate some breakfast, packed up, and headed to the Sunshine Wall area.  Aaron had found a new area for us to try out, Kotick Memorial Wall.  Kevin, Alicia, Ashley, and Alyssa started the day leading at the Feathers and joined us later.  After getting Indy and Tesla (Devin and Danika’s dogs) through the slot canyon/dog filter, we took a left and were immediately at that area.</p>

			<p>
			There was a group of sport climbers there but we were able to find a few routes for ourselves.   I geared up to lead Crack in the Back, a 5.6.  It was an interesting climb – mostly a face climb with a lot of stemming that ran up a crack you could protect with.  Unfortunately I only had my standard rack which included doubles of #.5 - #2, with a single #3.  The crack was pretty wide so I was sparingly trying to use my big gear.  I jammed in the crack like my life depended on it, getting a few good fist jams along the way.  The area was home to many pigeons so there was pigeon poop in the crack and I scared them away as I started up.  Finally I pulled the mantel and made it to the chains.  Danika cleaned for me for her first gear follow.</p>

			<p>
			Next I went and top roped the 5.9, Game of Inches, sport route Luke lead.  I had a lot of fun and felt comfortable enough that I decided to lead it myself.  We pulled the rope and Robert gave me a belay up.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Robert belaying me up A Game of Inches, my first 5.9 lead!</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			It was a fairly straight forward route with 5 bolts that you work up the face to the right arete, with a tricky crossover move to the left right below the anchor.  Luke’s draws were left at the anchor for me.  I was able to clip one but was having a hard time getting the rope in the second draw.  Finally I clobbered it in and lowered. I successfully lead my first 5.9 route!  Finally it was Aaron’s turn to lead something so he picked The Oral Office, a 5.8 just passed the little walk under.  Aaron had no problem with this 5.8 lead and I was up to follow and clean.  It was a crack climb with some face moves and a bit of stemming.  It was a fun route to follow.</p>

			<p>
			Robert had lead another sport route, Silhouttes, a 5.10a.  He and Rose encouraged me to try it out to see if I wanted to lead it.  I top roped it and felt really good during the middle section, but it was just a little too pumpy for me to feel comfortable on.  It was a fun route, but just a little beyond my comfort zone.  After Aaron and I had both climbed that, we sat down and made some lunch.</p>

			<p>
			The sport climbers from the morning were heading out but another big group was joining us.  I had my eye on a pillar that stood alone, with a 5.8 sport route on it’s face called the Rod of God.  Aaron gave me a belay up that which was really fun.  It was really easy with a nice block corner to head up.  After reaching the first ledge, a few moves brought you to the first bolt.  It was a ways up from the ground but didn’t seem as bad with the huge ledge/platform half way up.  4 bolts brought me to the top to build an anchor on the chains.  The chains were a bit offset so I wasn’t completely comfortable with my anchor.  After yelling back and forth with Aaron, I finally lowered.  My carabiner was right on the edge and I wasn’t crazy about that.  He cleaned and adjusted my anchor to fix that by moving my one sling from the bolt down a few links on the chain.  After that I think Alicia, Ashley, Devin, and Luke all took turns leading the same route – it was a lot of fun.</p>

			<p>
			We headed back through the little walk way and top roped the 5.9 Robert had lead, Heart Beat.  It was just a couple routes over from Aaron’s lead – The Oral Office.  It was an interesting climb with a few high moves and a big mantel at the top.  Everyone took their turn climbing that while Aaron decided to play with an off-width right next to The Oral Office.</p>

			It was early evening and everyone had a great day of climbing so we packed it up and headed back to camp.  The Easter Bunny (Rose) had visited after we left that morning and left chocolate bunnies and peeps in our tents, along with chocolate filled eggs in the cup holder of our chairs.  It was so nice and a great treat to come back to.  We started the fire and brought out the peeps for roasting.</p>

			<p>
			After having some fun with those and snacking a bit, I decided an afternoon nap sounded really good and went in the nice warm tent for a bit.  Aaron woke me when dinner was ready – jalapeño cheddar sausages, mmmm.  Ashley had brought a couple growlers from the Fremont Brewery and there was much PBR to go around.  We hung out by the campfire for a few more hours enjoying the company and finally turned in for bed.  Saturday night was definitely warmer than Friday night.</p>

			We woke up to sunshine and a strong wind.  As people ate breakfast, several decided to head back to Seattle to take advantage of the sunny, 60 degree weather there.  We packed up and drove over to the parking lot to head back to the Sunshine Wall.</p>

			<p>
			Aaron, Luke, Devin, Devin’s Friend, and I went over to the wall.  Aaron suggested I do Seven Virgins and a Mule, a 5.7 chimney route.  I geared up and started up.  The chimney was an interesting thing to climb.  I haven’t done a lot before and it definitely showed.  As I slowly inched my way up, I zipped up the crack with gear.  I alternated between chimney moves to make progress up and spotting some nice hand holds as well.  I actually stuck my left arm back through the crack and gripped the outside of the pillar to give myself some added purchase.  I finally reached the top of the chimney, climbed out on top of the pillar, and continued up a few more blocky moves to the top to set a gear anchor.  I found a great boulder to sling and stuck a couple more pieces in.  Since Aaron had led the route already, he let Luke follow me since he had not yet climbed it.  Soon Luke appeared on top of the pillar and we set about trying to figure out what anchors were within reach to set some top ropes.  There was a nearby 5.10c, Narlux, that Aaron wanted to try.</p>

				<span class="caption">Aaron climbing Narlux (5.10c) with the chimney of Seven Virgins and a Mule (5.7) to his left</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Luke got the rope set up and we hiked climbers left to find the gullies back.  There were many trails so I just followed those until I found the gully near Chapstick, the 5.6 I had lead the previous October.  Luke and Aaron both took turns top roping the 5.10c.  After that we ate some lunch and I grabbed some slings to lead the 5.6 sport route, Peaceful Warrior.  It was actually a bit more challenging than the 5.8 from the day before, Rod of God.  Rod of God had such nice blocky jugs.  Peaceful Warrior wasn’t super challenging, the holds just weren’t as bomber.  I made it to the top and lowered down.  Aaron cleaned it and Luke lead the route after me.  If you stayed more on the face, it was a 5.10a/b so Luke climbed that afterwards.</p>

			It was about 2PM so we decided we had climbed enough for the weekend and headed back to Seattle.  It was a great weekend of rock climbing in the desert with friends, not a bad Easter tradition to have!</p>
