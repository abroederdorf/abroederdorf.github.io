			<h1>Vantage: Noah Adventure Weekend Edition 10.20 - 10.21.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			Aaron's good friend from College, Noah, was heading back to Seattle for an adventure weekend in the mountains.  He had come out during the summer and Aaron took him rock climbing at Index, abusing him up a Aires, Pisces, and Great Northern Slab.  For some reason he decided he wanted more, and so took advantage of his fall break to fly back out.  Unfortuantely fall has found us so we went to the one sunny area we could find - Vantage.  After hanging out around Seattle for a couple days, Saturday morning we loaded up the jeep and headed east, towards the promise of sunnier skies.  After driving through rain, and then snow at the pass (it was sticking to the road and there were snow plows out!), we finally made it to the sunny eastside.  We got to the Feathers sometime after 10.  There were a ton of cars parked on the northside so we drove to the large southside area to find camping.  After driving around a bit, we found a somewhat suitable spot - although there were complaints about it being in the shade still mid-morning.  We set up camp, staked everything out really well since the winds were blowing, and grabbed our gear to head up to the Feathers. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We had seen Brian and Justin walking up there when we first arrived.  There was a large group of boy scouts that soon descended on the rock.  Luckily the southside of the Feathers is a bit more challenging so the boy scouts stuck to the northside mostly.  As everyone was soon pushed to the southside to escape the scouts, we grabbed what routes we could.  Brian put up <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/hardening-of-the-arteries/106515742">Hardening of the Arteries</a> (5.10c) while I jumped on <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/updrafts-to-heaven/106582665">Updrafts to Heaven</a> (5.5), the fun chimney we had found a couple years back.  I figured it'd be a good start to the weekend for Noah.  I shimmied through the bottom and started up, enjoying the chimney and stemming.  I lowered down and Sara cleaned the route.  Next up was Noah.  We were interested to see Noah and Justin fit in the bottom to do the climb.  Since they didn't have to follow the bolts, they didn't traverse the bottom in as far.  Noah did great and seemed to enjoy a nice easy chimney after the 5.8 off width and finger cracks he was forced to climb at Index.

			</center>
			<p>
			All of us took a turn on Hardening of the Arteries as well.  It was a challenging route but fun.  I stuck to the left corner to start, stemming off the two pillars, until I started my hand traverse across just above the first bolt, as guided by Aaron and Sara.  Some desparate grabs happend to find holds and I made my way up.

			</center>
			<p>
			Next, Brian decided to lead the nearby <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/wind-walker/106502546">Wind Walker</a> (5.10a) while Justin went down a few pillars to lead <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/me-too/106597507">Me Too</a> (5.9).  They both ran up the routes without much difficulty.  I top roped Wind Walker, as Brian thought it was a fairly easy 5.10a and I thought I might want to lead it.  I stayed mostly on the left side on the corner, and felt like I was cheating a bit.  Staying on the face at some of the bolts seemed a little sketchy to me, so after a fun top rope I decided I wouldn't be leading it.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">[Left] Brian leading Windwalker (5.10a). [Right] Justin leading Windwalker too</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Next I followed Justin up Me Too and cleaned the route.  I had climbed it my first time at Vantage a couple years back in March, still in the cold.  I had my puffy vest and wind shirt on while we were climbing in the sun, thank goodness for the sun.  The wind was pretty strong though and definitely made for some cooler climbing.  The six of us were doing a good job of cycling through the couple routes we had up and were getting some decent climbing in before lunch.

			<p>
			The last route Brian put up was <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/wish-i-were-skiing-at-49-degrees-north/106582654">Wish I Were Skiing at 49</a> (5.10b).  It was a challenging route for sure.  Aaron climbed it next, and then I top roped it.  The bottom section felt pumpy to me, but at least there was a giant ledge to stand on just before the crux so I could take a break.  Aaron told me I just had to move quickly through the section and go for it, so I did just that.  I found just enough good hand holds and made it up.  Once Sara had cleaned that route (she was anchor cleaning champ of the weekend), we went back to the car to grab lunch.

			<p>
			After lunch we decided to head over to Sunshine Wall and climb at Kotick Memorial Wall.  Justin went with Aaron and Noah to lead Oral Office (5.8), while Brian put up Game of Inches (5.9) for Sara and I.  People were winding down so after I cleaned Game of Inches, I lead <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/rod-of-god/107442251">Rod of God</a> (5.8).  I think it's a fun route, with a higher rating than its true difficulty.  It's almost like climbing a ladder I feel like.  Although, leading it, there are a few things to consider.  For one, the first bolt is way off the ground.  A few moves up from the ledge, but the ledge is a few moves off the ground too.  The first bolt I feel like is out a bit wide on the face too, just within my reach after positioning myself just right.  Luckily the rest of the bolts were easier to reach from the corner.  After I lead it, Aaron cleaned it in his approach shoes, followed by Brian top roping it in his running shoes.  As Noah was top roping Rod of God, Brian decided to put up one more route for the day - Falsies (5.9).  To end our day, we had a race between Sara on Rod of God and Justin on Falsies.  Sara won, but Justin had a difficult task of challenging a Hall of Famer.

			As we were walking back to camp, we met some fire fighters as they were topping out on the trail to the Sunshine Wall area.  The guys were in their full gear hauling bags of supplies up and were a bit out of breath.  Aaron gave them his water while Sara took the bag of supplies and the crew followed them to the fallen climber.  I went back to camp and grabbed head lamps, lanterns, a few snacks, and a sleeping bag as I didn't know how long we'd be out there.  A firefighter had left his coat and glasses at the top of the trail, so I grabbed those on my way back through.  It was just about dusk when I finally made my way back to the group.  The firefighters and paramedics had the guy on a back board and bandaged up.  Within a couple minutes of getting there, they started carrrying him down the path to the waiting helicopter.  Luckily there was a large enough flat spot just below the slot canyon for the helicopter to land, so they didn't have to get him all the way down to the valley.  Aaron and Brian helped carry the fallen climber, while Sara carried out the giant bag of supplies and Justin carried out the heart monitor.  After watching the helicopter take off, we all helped the rescue crew back up through the slot canyon and back to the cars.  Justin had some of the paramedics stand on his back to make it up into the slot canyon, while Sara led a group down with her lone headlamp.  Aaron put a few lanterns in the slot canyon when we went through to help light the way for the firefighters just in front of us.  I didn't hear what came of the climber, but I do know he was conscious and responding well so hopefully everything worked out for him.  Back at camp we grilled some sausage and enjoyed the warmth of a camp fire.  The stars were out and it was a great night.
			</p>
			<p>
			We woke up about 8:30 on Sunday, and slowly dragged ourselves ouf of the warmth of our sleeping bags.  We walked down to the sun (since our campsite was still in the shade) and ate some breakfast, while we figured out plans for the day.  After abusing Noah all weekend, putting him on some hard 5.10 routes, we thought it best to head back to the Feathers and climb some more typical routes beginners start on.  I was more than happy to lead some of those, so Sara and I went with Noah while Aaron went with Justin and Brian back to Sunshine Wall.  It was Brian's first time at Vantage so Sunshine Wall would be more fun, and Justin wanted to get some more leading in, so he wanted to do Seven Virgins and a Mule (5.7).  Unfortunately the easy stuff at the Feathers is on the Northside in the shade, but we sucked it up and went anyways.  We started at the far right end and worked our way back towards the walk through.  Sara started us by leading <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/feather-in-my-cap/106403086">Feather in my Cap</a> (5.5), made slightly more challenging by numb hands.  It's a really weird sensation to climb with cold hands, when you can't tell if you really have a hold or not.  We decided to just swap leading and cleaning responsibilities.  I went up last and on the great suggestion by Sara, just moved the rope over to the anchor for <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/ruffled-feathers/106403103">Ruffled Feathers</a> (5.7) which was on the same pillar.  We all took turns top roping that, and it was good to see how my hands were doing on the cold rock because I'd have to lead for real next.  Sara had her big puffy out, so I gladly grabbed it to keep it warm while she was on the rock.  It was cold in the shade so I put my gloves on when belaying, trying to keep some feeling in my fingers.  Sara cleaned Ruffled Feathers and I went to scout what was open.  It was relatively quiet when we first got to the rock, but more people had been trickling in.  The next route open was <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/beckey-route/106403137">Beckey Route</a> (5.7), so I decided to do that.  Another fun, sport Feathers route.  Noah followed me up it while Sara cleaned the anchor.

			<p>
			After that some routes opened up again so Sara picked out <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/mandatory-suicide/106403153">Mandatory Suicide</a> (5.4) for her next lead, the same route she first lead at Feathers during our Girls Easter Weekend climbing trip.  Sara flew up that, followed by Noah doing some stemming in the corner.  After I cleaned that anchor I jumped on <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/shake-it-dont-break-it/106399185">Shake It Don't Break It</a> (5.5).  That was the first route I had lead during the first Easter Weekend.  The first bolt is a bit high but after reaching that you're rewarded with some amazing jugs the rest of the way up.

			<p>
			We had gotten five climbs in before lunch, not too bad.  We were also ready for some warmth and gladly headed back through the walk through to the sunshine.  Just a few minutes after we got back to the car and made sandwiches, the rest of the crew rolled in from Sunshine Wall.  We relaxed and ate, then packed up camp to head back to Seattle.  Of course we stopped at DQ in Cle Elum on the way back for some ice cream.  It was a fun weekend of cragging.  We made good use of potentially one of the last weekends for cragging this year as the weather turns colder and wetter.
