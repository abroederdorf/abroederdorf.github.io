			<h1>Colchuck Lake 9.1 - 9.2.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			Matt was lucky enough to get a permit for the Enchanments over Labor Day.  He got two nights at Colchuck Lake so a plan to head into the Enchantments and climb Prusik Peak was soon formed.  I was super excited to go into the Enchantments.  We had been on the edge during the Dragontail-Colchuck adventure but visibility was so poor we couldn't see a thing.  We planned to head in Saturday afternoon, climb Sunday, and hike back out Monday.  I found some beta on a few walk-ups in the area too.  Just in case the West Ridge of Prusik was super busy, at least we'd still get to summit something.  After confirming we didn't have to pick up the permit by 9AM at the ranger station in Leavenworth, we slept in a bit and grabbed some delicious breakfast at the Sultan Bakery on the way Saturday.  After trying to find the ranger station (apparently none of us had ever been there), we had the permit and were headed down Icicle Creek road after a pit stop at Safeway for some Lime-a-ritas for the guys.  Leavenworth was packed and the Stuart Lake trailhead was no different.  We found a parking spot down by the bathrooms and geared up.  The guys had to try the Lime-a-ritas to make sure they wanted to carry the rest of the case with them, so that gave me time to complete my sunscreen lathering ritual.  At least it wasn't as hot as the last couple trips I'd been on, but I still started out at a nice slow pace.  I had decided I wanted to take my 36L pack with the warm camping gear (10 deg bag), climbing gear, and food for a few days so it was almost busting at the seams with everything crammed in.  I figured that was a bad choice in the end since it ended up coming in at about 37lbs - that pack just doesn't carry weight as well.  Luckily it didn't seem to be an issue and we made slow, steady progress up the trail.

			At the trail junction to Colchuck Lake the ranger was patrolling for permits, so we took the opportunity to take a break and grab some food and water.  There were several people that passed by during our short break, it was definitely a busy weekend.  Luckily most seemed to be day hikers but we were still curious how busy the route would be on Sunday. Unfortunately Sara said her shins were bothering her - heading uphill.  We kept that in mind as we started out.  I stopped about an hour later to gu, trying to stay ahead on my energy level.  Finally we had Colchuck and Dragontail in view with the lake below, in less time than we anticipated (although certainly not fast by any standard).

			It looked like someone was already camping on the beach, so we started around the lake checking the camping sites.  Matt found a good one near the pond so Aaron chose the little hobbit clearing in the trees for our tent, while Matt and Sara set up by the rock.  There was even a perfect little kitchen area with a rock for the table top and log for seating.  Aaron thought it'd be a lot of fun to make grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner, so we didn't have the dehydrated stuff for two nights in a row.

			He packed up a loaf of bread, 11 slices of cheese, and tub of butter while Matt brought his little frying pan for my jetboil.  Unfortunately he forgot the attachement so they guys set about finding rocks to use to keep the pan off the direct flame.  After the tents were up and sleeping bags unrolled, the food came out.  Matt and Aaron took care of the grilling while Sara and I built the sandwiches and happily ate them.  The grilled cheese was delicious.

			After dinner the crew scrambled up a huge boulder nearby while I made my way around the pond in search of one of the toilets.  When I got back, we decided to make some hot chocolate and walk back down the trail to a good sitting spot by the lake.

			The hot chocolate with schnapps was delicious.  Sara wasn't sure her shins could take Aasgard Pass on Sunday but decided she'd be more than happy to sit around camp all day, sleeping and reading.  We weren't so sure we were ok leaving her all day though so we decided to just hike out the next day instead and come tackle Prusik another day.  That meant the guys were going to enjoy all 8 Lime-a-ritas they brought that night.

			The setting sun cast a warm glow over the mountains, and soon the stars were coming out - as well as the headlamps turning on.  It was a weird activity to be spotting headlamps of groups still climbing, but we couldn't stop watching.  We saw one group top out on Colchuck Balanced Rock.  We saw a couple groups head down Aasgard Pass, and another group trying to make their way up Backbaone on Dragontail.  It was getting chilly and late so we walked back to camp before seeing the last group top out - hopefully they didn't epic.  After Aaron had some fun trying out night photography on his camera, we finally called it a night and crawled into out sleeping bags. 
			</p>
			<p>
			With no set plans for Sunday, we slept in a bit.  I was the last one to finally leave my sleeping bag and I joined the crew sitting on the rocks overlooking the pond.  I had a delicious breakfast of nutter butters and a giant pixie stick - sugar breakfast of champions?  When the four of us climb together, we tend to go a bit overboard with the sugar we bring along and consume - I feel good about it.  Sara suggested doing some more picture stuff with the four of us on rocks, so after a hilarious session of timed photos with my camera, trying to capture everyone jumping, we figured it was time to pack up and head out.

			We had Sara lead us out, in hopes of her going at a slower pace as to not destroy her shins even more, and started down the never ending trail back to the cars.  It was a great weekend to be out in the mountains with sunshine, good weather, and fun company.  I hadn't been out in three weeks so even though I still didn't get to go up in the Enchantments (someday!), I still had fun.
