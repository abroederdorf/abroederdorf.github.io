			<h1>BCC Crevasse Rescue - Niqually Glacier 5.6.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was that time again in the BCC when we drop students into crevasses so that others can learn how to pull them out.  We drove down to the instructor cabin near the Mt Rainier park entrance Saturday evening, arriving just in time for the potluck dinner.  We shared stories of the day, mostly about how awful the conditions were for the Saturday teams.  It was a complete whiteout so they did crevasse rescue down the slope of the moraine or from the big snow banks in the parking lot – not ideal.  Luckily the forecast was for sunshine and warm temperatures on Sunday – so nice that I left my big puffy at home (of course I still brought my little one).  We woke up a little before 6AM, got ready, and were in the Paradise parking lot by 7AM.   Talk about a beautiful day.  We had a clear view of Mt Rainier and the Tatoosh range.  I had gotten some sun from our prior week adventure up the Muir snowfield so I was determined to fight a better battle this week.  After applying lots of sunscreen and staying in the car as long as possible, I got out, tied a bandana over my neck and chin, and put my sun hat on.  It was fairly warm already so I only had on my long sleeve shirt.  The team gear was distributed and finally we were on our way, the third team out of the gate.</p>

			BCC crevasse rescue is always quite the sight with a long line of people marching up the Nisqually glacier, typically 10 – 15 per team with 4 teams.  I couldn’t get over how nice it was and kept my camera busy taking pictures of Rainier and the sunny snowfields we walked through.</p>

			When we reached the top of the moraine, we had the students don crampons for a little practice.  The snow was a little deep and soft for my liking so I just booted down.  At the base of the slope they took off their crampons and we got ready for some roped glacier travel.  I had Jackie, Vitaly, and Mike on my rope.  We had Jackie lead us, followed by me, then Vitaly, and Mike bringing up the rear.  We were the last team out and soon came to a stop from the bottle neck of teams.</p>

			We had two paths going but the snow was deep and kicking steps was work.  Lucky for us other rope teams kicked the steps, and instead we had to wait with some amazing views around us – darn.  The bottle neck was kind of fun because all of the teams were mixed together, so it gave me a chance to chat with members of other teams I don't usually get to climb with.</p>

			As we neared the lowest crevasse where Jason’s team had already set up, the rest of the teams were deciding where to head.  There were more crevasses up from us, but the going was slow.  It was determined we could fit all four teams around the same little system of crevasses so we all headed there.  Josh’s rope team made it over first, followed by mine. 
			</p>
			<p>
			After getting a few deadman set-up, Josh, Mike, and myself went down towards the lip of the crevasse to set anchors there for the fixed line and the back-up belayers.  The students were given additional anchors to place along the fixed line and our z-pulley stations.  Finally, after 2PM we lowered our first students in.</p>

			We were a bit behind as we are usually trying to head back down by 3PM!  Jason’s team finished very early so they took students from the other three teams to help cycle them through.  We continued on with our two rope teams and before long everyone had rotated through the stations.</p>

			Our last two students needed merely to go in the crevasse so we decided to direct haul Tricia out and used a z-pulley already set up to get Bryan out.  We quickly broke down our setup and Mike and I were on our way to pick up the couple students sent to Jason’s team.  After redistributing the rope for a 5 person team and waiting for the last rotation, we were heading down with Jaime leading, Mike, Jackie, myself, and Leigh.</p>

			The rest of the teams were waiting at the edge of the moraine for the final few rope teams to get down.  A quick transition found us soon on our way, traveling back up the side of the moraine to the Paradise area to hike back to the cars.  Every year I think the hike back should be shorter than what it is.  It was just after 7PM so the sun was setting, casting a nice glow over the mountains.  We finally spotted the parking lot and were back down about 7:45PM.  After a quick z-pulley quiz, we were in the cars.  We stopped at Bruno’s for some delicious dinner and were finally on our way home, arriving back at 11:45PM.  It was a long day but at least we had beautiful mountain weather to enjoy!</p>
