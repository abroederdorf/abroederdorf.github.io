			<h1>Snow Lake 2.4.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			The guys were planning on heading up to Lillooet in British Columbia to do some ice climbing in mid February.  In preparation they wanted to find some ice to climb locally.  It had been raining in Leavenworth so that area was out.  They decided to check out the Snow Lake area instead.  Sara and I joined them on their adventure.  It was a gorgeous day; lots of sunshine and – wind.  We parked near Alpental, geared up, put on our snowshoes, and hit the trail.  Sara lead the group through the trails. Luke and Aaron P had big loads as they were planning to camp and climb Chair Peak the next day.  I hadn’t been out in the mountains since my Guye Peak adventure almost a month earlier so it was good to be out.</p>

			We stopped just before reaching the slope west of Source Lake to put sunscreen on as the face was bathed in sunlight.  The views of the peaks were beautiful.  I picked out the Tooth which I had climbed that summer with Sara, and the guys pointed out Chair Peak.</p>

			We spotted a bit of ice on the ridgeline and a couple people climbing one of the pitches.  You could see the skin tracks heading up the face below Chair Peak and we soon were part of the zig zagging dots following the snowshoe track up.  We reached the ridge above Snow Lake and kept moving – the wind was terrible.  We worked our way east to near where the summer trail descends and descended ourselves.  The snow was deep but soft.  After trudging down the hillside we reached the lake.</p>

			The guys were hoping to find some good ice along the lake.  Snow Lake was frozen over with quite the dramatic snow covering that was sculpted by the winds.  A big wind would kick up clouds of snow around us as we plodded along.  We came across some great looking rocks but no good ice to climb.</p>

			We reached the other end of the lake where a gully delivered many backcountry skiers to the lake.  The guys decided to head up that way to find ice to climb.  Sara lead out again and soon found herself armpit deep in a hole in the snow.  There was a large open pocket in the snow so Sara dangled by her arms until Luke and Aaron N reached her to give her a hand in crawling back out of the hole.  Carefully avoiding that section, we started up the gully.</p>

			It was fairly steep and work – especially since I hadn’t been out climbing in a while.  Armed with snowshoes and trekking poles we made our way up.  Aaron P ran up a head a little and found a great cave conveniently by some potential ice to climb.  We filed into the cave and sat down to enjoy a nice lunch out of the wind.</p>

			After lunch Aaron P and Luke geared up to climb the ice.  Aaron N and Matt grabbed some tools to go wonder around the area and see what they could find.  Sara and I grabbed some seats at the entrance of the cave to watch Aaron P and Luke climb while taking pictures.  They started up but found the ice was a little more challenging than they expected.  After both giving it a go, they backed off and decided they had had enough for the day.  Aaron P was still recovering from his sinus surgery so he decided to call it a weekend as it was his first time back in the mountains as well, and forgo the attempt on Chair.  We packed up and hiked up another 1000’ or so to reach the notch near Chair Peak.  It was still super windy and you could see the snow blowing off of the summits.  We made our way down and found the boot pack crisscrossing the slope again.  Once we were on that, we were soon back on the normal trail and back at the cars before we knew it.  A stop at the North Bend Bar and Grill was a great end to a fun day in the mountains.</p>
