			<h1>Vantage 6.3.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			Ingalls has been near the top of my to-climb list for about a year now.  Last October I thought we found a weekend, but the weather forecast turned south and our one day attempt was foiled by Oktoberfest the night before.  The climb retained its position on my to-climb list for 2012 so we planned June 2/3 for a two day attempt.  The group would be Sara, Alicia, Ashley, and I.   We'd hike in Saturday afternoon, climb Sunday morning, and then head back to Seattle.  As the weekend neared, the weather forecast started casting doubts on our plans.  Rain Saturday morning and chance of snow throughout the rest of the weekend was predicted.  Thursday we finally decided to ditch plans and looked elsewhere.  Most of the alpine climbs in the state that are on my radar had a forecast for snow, so we looked to the cragging areas.  Both Vantage and Leavenworth looked promising, so we decided to head to Vantage for the day on Sunday.  Matt, Aaron, Chris, and Melissa would be joining the crew for some fun in the sun.
			</p>
			<p>
			We met at 6:30AM in Seattle on Sunday and piled into the two cars.  Packing took about 5 minutes the night before, in contrast to my last trip which was an attempt on Rainier - it was a nice change.  We stopped in North Bend at Starbucks for some breakfast and continued to Vantage.  The Cascades were enveloped in clouds, we couldn't even see Guye Peak from I-90 as we drove over Snoqualmie Pass.  As we made our way east the conditions seemed to improve.  After a quick pit stop in Vantage we made our way to the parking lot for Sunshine Wall.  There were several cars at the Feathers, but other than one large group at the end, it didn't seem overly crowded.  The parking lot for Sunshine Wall also seemed relatively empty - a good sign for the day.  Alicia, Ashley, Chris and Melissa went to the Feathers to start, to get Chris his first lead.  They went to Satan's Pillar so Chris could lead the Notch Route (5.6) and they also climbed Altar of Sacrifice (5.7).
			</p>
			<p>
			Matt, Sara, Aaron, and I headed for Sunshine Wall without a particular area in mind.  We decided to head west and finally ended up at the Air Guitar Area along King Pins.  There were a couple guys climbing there already, but the boys soon picked out Stroken' the Chicken (5.6) and <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/vantage-point/106399158">Vantage Point</a> (5.8) for our starting routes - which were then delegated to the girls to lead.  Sara chose Vantage Point which left me Stroken' the Chicken, the one I would have picked as my warm up anyways.  I geared up and scrambled up to the start.

			I took my normal rack through #3, plus a #4.  Aaron didn't think I'd need double #3 or #4.  Once up to the start, the crack was looking somewhat large and I thought back to the last time I was at Vantage and lead Crack in the Back (5.6) at Kotick Memorial Wall for my warm-up.  It was a larger crack and I would have appreciated some bigger gear.  This climb was shaping up to be a repeat.  I placed a #0.75 not far off the deck, then a #1, a #2 and I was to my big gear.  I tried to run it out a bit before my next piece as I had a lot of the route above me still.  I placed my #3 and kept going, every so often seeing if I could find a slot for my other #2.  I spotted a chockstone in the crack.  It seemed pretty solid so I slung that.  Finally I wanted another piece in so I decided to start walking my #4 up.  There was a chockstone in the right crack up above with slings and rap rings.  I wanted to make my way up to that and sling it as my next piece at least.  I moved the #4 a few times and made my way to the chockstone.  After discussions with Aaron and not feeling very comfortable finishing the rest of the climb with a single #4 at my disposal (and no more chockstones in sight), I decided to lower from the slung chockstone.  I checked out the slings and cord and the chockstone was solid, so I lowered.  Aaron followed up and unhappily rappelled down from the chockstone as well.  Everyone else decided to avoid that route for the day.

			Meanwhile, Sara had lead Vantage Point and Matt lead it after her.  I volunteered to follow and clean the route - it had been a while since I cleaned a route.  It was a sustained 5.8 on the corner.

			I took a couple times on the way up and somehow managed to navigate my way past the crux just before the top.  Next, Matt decided to lead <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/crossing-the-threshold/106582684">Crossing the Threshold</a> (5.8), a twin crack system, while Sara chose <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/clip-em-or-skip-em/106399166">Clip'em or Skip'em</a> (5.8), another corner route with lots of bolts to clip.  Both Matt and Sara made it up no problem.  Clip'em or Skip'em was a little less sustained after Vantage Point but was a fun route.

			We pulled the rope on Clip'em or Skip'em so that I could lead it next, while Chris cleaned Crossing the Threshold.  It was a long, interesting stemming problem, a bit wide at the bottom for us shorter people.

			Alicia lead Vantage Point while the rest of us played on Crossing the Threshold.  Then her and Ashley took turns leading Clip'em or Skip'em.  Melissa was a great sport and did well on all the climbs we threw at her.  Chris got the route cleaning award for the day, cleaning most all of the routes.

			As everyone got to climb Vantage Point, Clip'em or Skip'em, and Crossing the Threshold we pulled the ropes and started cleaning up.  I had brought my mountaineering boots to get a little practice climbing in them.  Aaron encouraged me to climb Black Peak in my boots, and as I'm not super comfortable climbing in them, suggested I get some practice.  We headed down to Chapstick (5.6) but there was a group already climbing in the area so we went back to our crew.  Another climbing pair had put up <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/air-guitar/105802381">Air Guitar</a> (5.10a) which Aaron had been eyeing all morning, so he and Matt took turns top roping that, as Sara and I made our way over to Kotick Memorial Wall for a few more climbs.

			Sara picked out <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/falsies/107442268">Falsies</a> (5.9) to lead, another sport route up a corner, with a very challenging start.  Once she got the first bolt clipped, she was on her way.  Sara had just topped out when the rest of the crew joined us.  I decided/was encouraged to follow the route in my boots.  It was a bit challenging.  The toe box is so much bigger, it's hard to see the little ledges and feel comfortable on them.  I was definitely climbing more with my arms, finding bomber hand holds.  I took a few times on the way up but finally made it.  Definitely the sight to see - not only my fashion sense with rolled-up capris, wool socks, and mountaineering boots, but I'm sure my climbing technique looked dreadful (it felt kind of that way).
			</p>
			<p>
			Alicia and Ashley wanted to get at least one trad lead in so they picked the next route to the right, <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/crack-in-the-back/107442225">Crack in the Back</a> (5.6).  After advising them to get some big gear, Alicia started up. As she lead that, Aaron decided he wanted to top rope Falsies in his approach shoes.

			<p>
			I grabbed some snacks, and then decided to try leading the <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/chimney-behind-rod-of-god/107442256">chimney behind rod of god</a>, a 5.5 route that was apparently also a really good stemming route.  Five bolts led up to the anchor.  There were fairly good ledges on the corners for stemming, and generally good hand holds throughout.  Most of the group had fun climbing that route, some choosing to stem, chimney, or a combination of the two.

			After Melissa had cleaned Crack in the Back, I top roped it to get another route in with my boots.  It was another stemming problem, one of several throughout the day.  After that Ashley took her turn leading Crack in the Back, letting Chris get his final route cleaning in for the day.  After everyone finished up on those routes, we headed back to the cars.  Chris had 3 racks of ribs waiting for us and within minutes the eight of us had devoured them - they were delicious!  A stop at DQ in Cle Elum for some ice cream topped off a fun day playing on the rocks.
