			<h1>BCC Chair Peak Area (Make-Up) 3.24.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			A few students needed to make up the snow skills outing at Stevens Pass so five instructors volunteered to head up towards Chair Peak near Snoqualmie Pass to do a make up outing.  The forecast looked good for Saturday, not so much for Sunday, so I was looking forward to getting out in the nice weather.  Aaron and I met two of the students, Carlee and Steve, at the Green Lake park and ride at 5:15AM so that we could make a pit stop in North Bend at the Starbucks and get to the parking lot at Snoqualmie Summit West by 6:30AM.  We arrived on time, geared up, and found the hidden road side bathroom.  Once everyone was ready we drove to the upper parking lot Alpental and hit the trail.</p>

			We followed the first part of the trail, letting the students stop for a little navigation practice.  Once we were out of the trees a little bit, Devin found a good spot to do a step kicking demonstration.  After that we stayed mostly off of the trail, kicking steps through the thigh deep snow with a lovely crust on top.  With a smaller group, everyone pitched in kicking steps.</p>

			We did get an avalanche gully crossing practice in too.  We soon reached Source Lake and picked out a promising looking slope to start ice axe arrest practice on.  While everyone glissaded down together to make the chute, I set about stamping out a nice platform for the snow anchor demonstration later. Once the chute was ready I headed half way up with camera in hand to get pictures of everyone arresting.  The students did a great job, although Carlee had the fastest outfit on that sent her flying down the slope a few times.  Some of the instructors had a lot of fun sliding down as well.  I demonstrated a different arrest position this week, head first face down.  Aaron helped me slowly go through the steps.</p>

			After everyone felt comfortable with self arresting, we moved on to the snow anchors.  Bill talked about using a picket as a picket, Aaron talked about using it as a deadman, and I talked about using a random object as a deadman.  I picked out a bag but we didn’t pack the snow down well enough and the bag actually ended up ripping through.</p>

			After our demonstrations the students got to try their hand at building each of the anchors and testing them out.  Devin showed the bollard he made and had the students test that as well.  Next it was on to belay techniques – boot axe and carabiner axe.  Everyone did well with that too.</p>

			The next skill of the day was rope travel, another one I got to demonstrate.  After showing the students the trick to dividing a rope for a four person team, they tied in and we started up the slope toward Chair Peak.  The snow was deep and instead of making the front student on the rope team kick all of the steps, Bill and I went up to help out.</p>

			Part way up the slope we figured they had enough practice and let them unrope.  Trying to match the elevation gain from the Stevens outing, we continued upwards towards Chair Peak instead of heading over for a view of Snow Lake.  We made our way up, kicking steps – sometimes swimming, and eventually made it to the bump.</p>

			The bump – our local summit for the day!  We radioed to the other teams that we had made it.  The students did not disappoint with summit treats and I brought peeps to share.  After some tasty hot chocolate and a group ‘summit’ shot, we packed back up and Tim demonstrated how to plunge step.</p>

			After the students got an opportunity to practice plunge stepping, we had a little fun and showed them how to glissade, and then how to somersault.  Everyone had a great time in the beautiful weather and we made it back to the parking lot by 4.  Since we were separate from the Saturday teams in the Commonwealth Basin, we were allowed to leave so we got home at a reasonable time so that we could all get up on Sunday for another adventure.</p>
