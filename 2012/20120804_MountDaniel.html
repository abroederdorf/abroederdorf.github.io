			<h1>Mount Daniel - Southeast Ridge 8.4 - 8.5.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			After a great weekend with a successful summit of Black Peak, I was looking forward to another awesome weekend in the mountains.  The weather looked good and I could go play - my climbing season had finally started.  My only request for the weekend was to head up something and take in the mountain vistas.  Sara, Matt, Aaron, and I decided we'd go for a more relaxed weekend, i.e. no technical climbing.  We looked through our list of mountains, slowly narrowing it down.  No to Baker, Matt has climbed that way too many times.  No to Shuksan - we want to do the north face which is more technical.  Mt St Helens we'd save for next spring when we can ski it.  Thought we'd hold off on Eldorado for a three day weekend to tag Eldorado, the Needle, and Klawatti.  That left Gothic Basin with Gothic and Del Campo, and Mount Daniel which Matt had suggested.  Matt's other suggestion of Three Fingers was quickly crossed off the list after Sara and I figured out it required a 15 mile bike ride up 1600', just to reach the trailhead.  All of us had been in towards Gothic Basin at some point over the past couple years, but none had tagged the summits.  Sara had done a trip into Peggy's Pond for Mount Daniel when she first got to the northwest but hadn't gotten that summit either.  She finally picked Mount Daniel as our objective for the weekend.  Of course Cathedral Rock is there taunting us, but after checking into the routes, we decided to stick with our non-technical rule and planned to camp at Peggy's Pond and then ascend the Southeast Ridge of Daniel to tag the summit.  The weather was looking sunny with very hot temperatures.  We were packing light with no technical gear - brought the tents sans flies and the 30 degree sleeping bags.  I still brought my little puffy and down booties, wanting to make sure I would stay warm.  We all packed our flip flops so we could lounge around camp and bug spray - boy did we need bug spray.
			</p>
			<p>
			It's about a three hour drive to the Cathedral trailhead to head up to Peggy's Pond.  The last hour would be up a very rough, pot-hole filled forest service road for about 12 miles.  We decided to use a similar schedule to the previous weekend trip.  We left Seattle at 8AM and were faced with our first major decision of the weekend (well, after finally figuring out where we were going) - where to eat breakfast.  We figured we'd have to stop in North Bend or wait until Cle Elum.  Sara used the nerd phone to do some research and came up with a couple possibilities in North Bend - we finally decided on trying the The Riverbend Cafe, off of exit 32 by the golf course.  That was an outstanding decision.  Breakfast was delicious and a few of the amazing homemade bagels were bought to bring along on the trip.  After we were all full, we got to sit in the car for a couple more hours as we made our way to the trailhead.  It was already warm and sitting in the sun in the car didn't help, nor did the fact that Snow Pea (Aaron's Jeep) doesn't really have working air conditioning.  However, Snow Pea was a great vehicle to get us up the road to the trailhead.  We hit Roslyn, rolled down the windows, and prepared for our next challenge - finding the right forest service road to get to the trailhead.  After a start, backup and go again to find the end of the wrong road, we were heading up the right road with some hilarious bumps and synchronized swaying in the car.  Aaron was doing the best he could driving - the road was just ridiculous, and thus hilarious. However, we did make it up and back without me getting sick so I'd say he was a pretty successful driver.  Aaron's favorite part of the whole weekend was the stream crossing the road that he got to drive through.
			</p>
			<p>
			We reached a very full trailhead and found a mostly shady spot along the road to park.  As we geared up, everyone decided (I eventually did after some encouragement) to ditch shirts and hike up in shorts.  It was hot and the less clothing the better.  This just meant I had a lot more sunscreening to do!

			After tracking down a pencil and registering at the trailhead, we set off at Sara pace.  Entirely too fast for me, we split into Sara and Matt up ahead while Aaron stayed back with me as I slowly trudged up the trail.  It was a very well maintained trail, luckily through the trees to keep the heat a little more at bay.  Having a nice light pack after the Black Peak trip was a welcomed change.  We met a few groups heading down the trail from camping at the various lakes in the area.  Finally we came upon Squaw Lake and decided to take a break.

			We dropped packs, grabbed food, and hung out by the lake for a while.  Aaron even decided to wade in to cool off.  The mosquitoes started at the lake so I grabbed bug spray, an ominous sign for the rest of the weekend.  After everyone was rested, we grabbed our packs and hit the trail.

			Sara promised a traverse, followed by a bit of scrambling beneath Cathedral Rock, and then onto Peggy's Pond.  After heading up from Squaw Lake (with much grumbling about the 'traverse') we came upon some tarns and our first mountain views.

			As we neared Cathedral Rock we found Deep Lake below and a great mountain view to the south.  We followed Sara as she started on the traverse/scramble below Cathedral Rock and we picked our way across in the sun.  We came to a junction when we were almost past Cathedral Rock and decided to continue straight ahead instead of taking the trail up.  We picked our way through the trees and finally came to a nice frozen pond.  We made it!  Now we just had to find a campsite.  There was a rushing stream we had to cross and quite a bit of snow.

			The bugs were annoying as everyone spread out to find a spot.  We were hoping for a snow free spot to camp.  Some guys camping on a knoll nearby said there were more spots at another lake over a little further.  We headed that way and finally found Peggy's Pond - we were at the wrong one!  The guys found a couple of good potential camp spots and we finally decided on an area north of the pond, by a stream emptying into it.  We found just enough dry ground to set up the two tents and got to work.

			First thing I did was put my shirt and pant legs back on, to help fend off the mosquitoes.  The guys put their beer in the stream to cool off, while Sara and I buried the white wine in the snow.  We may have packed light in terms of gear, but we brought lots of goodies to enjoy during the weekend.  4 IPAs and a box of red wine for the guys; a box of white wine and hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps for the girls; and more candy than you could count (fun dip; nerds; little pixie sticks after I tried in vain to find big ones at 5 different stores; laffy taffy; sour straws; sour watermelons).  The guys started filtering water so I thought we could get dinner started.  Sara and I made our rice and chicken Mountain House meals while the guys decided in the end to hold off for a while.

			Aaron napped while I ate (I actually ate the whole meal!) until I couldn't stand the mosquitoes attacking my feet any longer and joined him in the tent.  Shielded from the mosquitoes, I stripped down a bit because it was still really hot out.  As soon as the sun dropped below Mount Daniel, the temperature dropped at least 10 degrees so I could get my mosquito gear back on.

			After everyone rested a bit, the guys decided it was time for IPAs and dinner.  Sara and I stayed in her tent to avoid the mosquitoes while we stared on the snow chilled wine.  Aaron had music playing and we enjoyed the night.  As the sun went down we got ready for bed.  It was a nice sunset but I didn't dare venture outside the tent for longer than I had to, so I missed some of those pictures.  Aaron was worried about me getting cold so he decided the best option was to zip our sleeping bags together - nice thought but not sure it quite had the results he was hoping for.

			Alarm went off about 6AM.  After snoozing for a bit, I finally sat up to start eating breakfast and getting ready for the climb.  I may have pushed the wine and schnapps a little hard the night before so Sara wasn't feeling the greatest - my bad. She powered through though and we left camp about 7:30AM to start for the ridge.  The beta I found said to head to the northside as it was easier to gain the ridge there.  As we made our way across the trails, we started up the rocks.  Unfortunately we went too far north and found ourselves on top of a large pile of rocks, with a little valley separating us from the ridge we actually wanted to be on.  We went back down and found our way up onto the ridge.  First route finding snafu of the day.

			Once on the ridge the route was much more straightforward.  There were a couple groups that had started up before us that day so we watched their progress.  They were more out on the snow on the face while the beta said to stick to the ridge.  We decided to follow the beta and continued up.  The ridge is described as class 2 hiking with bits of class 3 scrambling.  There were several large rock outcroppings to scramble over, as well as plenty of chossy trail to follow.

			As we went up, I got those mountain vistas I was hoping for.  We could see Mt Adams and Mt Rainier to the south, in addition to all the nearby Alpine Lakes like Deep Lake, Circle Lake, Venus Lake, and Spade lake.

			The rock on Mount Daniel was very interesting, you could see the volcanic remnants.  As we turned north up the ridge to head to the East Summit, we re-evaluated our climbing plan.  The real summit was the West summit and we could now see the chossy trail separating us from it.  Not a hard hike over by any means, but we figured an annoying one.  It was a little later in the day than we hoped, so after much debate, we finally decided to tag the East Summit and then head down so we could get some food and beer at the Brick Saloon in Roslyn at a decent time.

			<p>
			We scrambled up the last of the loose rock to reach the East Summit and grabbed our snacks.  Mount Daniel is the highest point in King County and does not disappoint with views.  We had Mt Adams and Mt Rainier to the south, beautiful Alpine lakes to the south/southwest, Mt Baker and Glacier Peak to the north/northwest, and Mount Stuart to the east.  After some summit shots (involving a very well engineered tripod from three trekking poles and my little gorillapod) and more candy, we packed up to head down.

			Half the time spent on the summit involved discussion of which way we were going to go down.  A climbing pair was headed down the Hyas Creek Snowfield, so after we saw we could clear the rock band, we decided that would be a faster and better alternative to heading back down the southeast ridge.

			The guys started down first with Sara and I following as we plunge stepped down.  The snow wasn't too bad but every so often I'd hit a patch and my heel would just bounce off and a sliding I would go.  Not far ever, but it was nice to have the ice axe at the ready.  After we made it down a ways we started traversing to the south (skiers right) to get around the rocks.  The guys out front kicked huge steps so Sara and I went a bit slower, trying to kick some intermediate steps for ourselves.

			Finally we reached the guys on the rocks, headed down a bit further, and got a nice little - very bumpy - glissade in.  After that it was a bit more walking through the snowfield to its mouth, where we had crossed earlier that day on our route finding snafu.

			It was really warm and most of us were running low on water.  Aaron lead us to the trail he had found that morning and from there, it was a short hike back to the camp.  I think the only time throughout the entire day that the mosquitoes left us alone was on the summit.  I was stopping to swat and kill constantly, and we were dousing ourselves in bug spray.

			Back at camp we broke everything down as quickly as possible, as we killed 3 - 4 mosquitoes at a time on each other with one swat.  After filtering more water and getting everyone started on rehydrating, we set off.  We took the trail from Peggy's Pond down and intersected the other trail we had taken below Cathedral Rock.  We made quick work of the scramble back across, and as soon as we found a nice shady spot I zipped off my pant legs to get some relief from the heat.  Sara lead us back down the 'traverse' to Squaw Lake where we took another break.

			Both of the guys jumped in the lake to cool off while I tried to avoid the bugs.  After a nice break and some food, we packed back up and started down the trail with the Brick Saloon motivating us.  The trail down always seems longer but luckily it was through the trees to escape the sun.  Aaron had his music playing and before long, we were crossing the final bridge right before the trailhead.  Glad to get into clean clothes, we packed up the jeep and started down the road again - still just as bumpy as the day before.  We made it back to Roslyn about 6:30, great timing for some burgers at the Brick Saloon.  I drove the rest of the way back to Seattle and got to deal with the traffic on I-90.  As a treat, we stopped for some gelato back in Wallingford before heading home.  It was a fun weekend with great mountain vistas despite the heat and bugs, and a great first outing for the four of us.
