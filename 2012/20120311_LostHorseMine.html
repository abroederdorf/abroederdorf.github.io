			<h1>Lost Horse Mine 3.11.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			On our third day at Joshua Tree we decided to take a break from rock climbing and go for a hike.  Aaron had heard there was a cool mine so we chose the Lost Horse Mine trail, 4 miles roundtrip to the mine or there was a 6.2 mile loop that passed by the mine.  At the end of a long, mostly single lane, gravel road we found a full parking lot in the early afternoon on Sunday.  Matt made himself a parking spot along the road (thankfully we had the truck) and we packed up a few bags with water, sunscreen, and cameras before hitting the trail. The trail wound through some familiar landscape including Joshua Trees and Yucca plants, although it was in a hillier region.  One new plant that was prevalent was the Juniper Bush – they were everywhere!</p>

			There were also many interesting rocks along the trail, including quartz and sedimentary rocks.  I liked all of the colors and layers of the sedimentary rocks.</p>

			The sun was out and I enjoyed stopping to take pictures along the way, trailing quite some distance behind Dan, Lauren, Matt, and Sara.  Soon the Joshua Trees became sparse and we entered a region devastated by a wild fire.</p>

			Everything was shades of brown, quite different from the green desert vegetation we’d been seeing.  We came around a corner and spotted the mine on a hillside in the distance – getting closer!  Another couple we were playing leap frog with on the trail found a little lizard so we took a picture and kept going.</p>

			As we neared the mine we started seeing signs of it – old, broken cable and sections of rail and other metal.  The turnoff to the mine isn’t well marked although the mine is clearly in sight.  The best sign are those directing you to continue along the main trail – that’s when you’ve hit the side trails.  A couple more switchbacks would land us at the mine.  Unfortunately Aaron wasn’t feeling well so he left the pack with me and headed back to the car.  I continued another minute or two to the fenced in mine.</p>

			The old wooden structure left at the mine looked like it would be a great tree house – if only it weren’t fenced off.  Instead, my fascination was caught by the random things left outside the fence – old foundations, rusty equipment like bolts and gears, cable, and other structure.</p>

			We all had fun taking pictures, I employing the use of the macro setting on my camera.  The views of the surrounding brown hills were nice – at least there was a brilliant blue sky.  We even had a couple little ground squirrels try to make friends with us, I’m sure looking for some spare tourist food.</p>

			After we snapped our fill of pictures we headed back down the trail to the car, forgoing the rest of the loop.  When I wasn’t taking more pictures of the desert landscape, Matt and Sara kept me entertained on the hike out.  It was a nice little jaunt to give our hands a break from the rough rock, and a fun opportunity to take some more pictures of the desert we’d soon be leaving.</p>
