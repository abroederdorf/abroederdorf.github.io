			<h1>BCC Big Chief 3.18.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was finally time for the first BCC team outing of the 2012 season so we headed to Big Chief at Stevens Pass to work on snow skills.  The prior Wednesday night at lecture we were given our team assignments for the first time so we got to meet everyone and do a little bit of trip planning.  I’m part of team 6 this year, seems like a good group.  We quickly assigned instructors skills to teach and waited for the students.  After quick introductions we discussed our planned approach and called it an evening.  Sunday morning we left the Greenlake Park and Ride at 5am and headed for the pass.  Road conditions were good and we showed up a few minutes before 6:30am to gear up and join the rest of the team in the parking lot.  We had our whole team in attendance – all instructors and students.</p>

			After divvying up the group gear of pickets and ropes among the students, we crossed highway 2 and started up right about 7am.  Charlie first explained how to hold an ice axe, followed by Josh giving a demonstration of how to kick steps.</p>

			We started up, wallowing/swimming through the deep snow.  The goal for everyone was to kick 30 steps and step out of line.  It was slow progress and after while, Tony directed us to use any steps we could find so that we could gain the ridge and continue practicing the other skills.</p>

			After four hours we finally gained the ridge, the last team up, and set to building some chutes for practicing ice axe self arrest.  We sent people down two-by-two to try and create a wide enough path.</p>

			I started off with the feet first-face down arrest position, and then the students all got turns to practice it a couple times.  The other three positions were demonstrated, each demonstration followed by more practice.  I planted myself half way down to get pictures of people as they passed by.  As a student I really wanted to be able to share the things I was learning with friends and family that had no idea what was involved, so I wanted to provide pictures for the students this year to have that opportunity.</p>

			After ice axe self arrest practice we moved on-to snow anchors.  I demonstrated the picket-as-a-picket while Danika showed the picket-as-a-deadman.  The students then got an opportunity to build and test snow anchors themselves.  Next up was the snow belay techniques – boot axe belay and carabiner belay.  While the students worked on those skills, Josh dug an avalanche pit and gave a talk on how to use one.  It was very interesting to me as I haven’t gone through any avalanche courses.</p>

			Next up was rope travel.  After explaining that, Danika and I wrestled with a very knotted rope for our team of three and got ready to head to the summit.  As I was waiting, they were looking for a volunteer to help out another team so I volunteered.  There was a student having breathing issues so a couple instructors were going to travel across the ridge with her to the ski resort area to see if we could get her downloaded on a chair.  Sam knew the backside lifts were stopped by then (after 3PM), so we were hoping Tye Mill would still be running.  Not knowing if they could download on that chair, we figured they could at least call ski patrol to come help.</p>

			After grabbing a radio we started across the ridge to the ski area.  The day had been fairly pleasant with intermittent sunshine and descent views.  As soon as we started across the ridge the blowing snow came and it was cold.  It was almost comical heading down the ski runs we knew only from skis.  It was a bit slick and I fell once.  We finally reached the first chair lift and as expected it was not operational.  We were back in the resort and new the path to Tye Mill from there.  As we neared Tye Mill it didn’t look like it was working – our worst fears realized.  We headed over and looked for some sort of phone on the outside of the lift tower with no luck.  Sam decided to try the lower door as it only looked to be secured with a bungee cord.  It was so we stepped inside to get out of the wind while we figured out our next steps.  An earlier group of instructors had headed down with another injured student earlier so we tried reaching them via radio.  No answer.  We just started calling for any BOEALPS teams down at the parking lot and luckily both Team 5 and 7 were close.  We explained the situation and they spent a few minutes to figure out a plan.  We were hoping to get a hold of someone down by the lodge to go get ski patrol.  They came back on and asked if there was a phone.  I went upstairs to investigate and found that door unlocked as well – with a phone inside.  I got Sam and after scanning the convenient phone list posted there, she called down to ski patrol.  Dana was already there explaining the situation so after conferring our location, they hung up with a promise to get back to us with more information.  I went downstairs to grab out gear out of the room and close it back up, and within 10 minutes a ski patrol guy appeared with a snowmobile to take the student down.</p>
			<p>
			As the snowmobile could only fit those two, Sam and I geared back up and got ready for the hike back down through the ski resort.  I don’t think either of us ever imagined hiking through the Stevens Pass ski resort with ice axe in hand.  Our plan was to glissade down – easy enough.  Unfortunately the slopes weren’t steep enough and the new couple inches of snow made it almost impossible.  We tried every slope we could to no avail.  I somewhat got going towards the bottom of Tye Mill, just before you hit the bottom ski lift but I had to be leaning back with only my butt in contact with the snow in my rain pants.  The picket attached to Sam’s pack hung too low and acted as anchor to prevent her from glissading so she quickly caught up to my slow progress by hiking down.  After crossing the flat section of the promenade we were hoping to glissade down some of those slopes but finally gave up and walked the rest of the way to the parking lot.  We were surprised not to be the last ones down as my team was still heading down, but we made it.  After waiting in the parking lot for the rest of the team, we headed to Sultan for some delicious Mexican food.</p>
