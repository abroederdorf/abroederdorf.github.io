			<h1>BRC Leavenworth - Clamshell 6.10.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			The first outing for BRC was here which meant it was time to head to Leavenworth.  Aaron and I were thinking about trying to climb elsewhere but the weather wasn’t cooperating very well.  We had been thinking about going down to Mt Hood since it’s still on my list to summit and had the best forecast, but Thursday NWAC put out an avalanche warning for the volcanoes above 7/8,000 feet and there were some strong winds predicted for Sunday, our planned summit day.  Instead, we decided to join BRC and help teach on Sunday since weather was looking a little iffy in Leavenworth on Saturday.  We left Seattle about 2:45PM and got to the Wenatchee Lake State park, the group campground for the weekend, about 5PM.  We had gotten a message that class finished about 3PM and they were headed to town for drinking, so when we showed up to the campsite it was fairly deserted.
			</p>
			<p>
			Aaron and I set up our car camping stuff – 4 person tent with our two comfort series 4” thick sleeping pads.  I finished marking some of the new gear I’ve gotten this year, just in time as everyone rolled back into camp.  Before long the food was out and the fire was started.  Stories of the day were retold and delicious food was consumed.  Finally it was time for the rope rodeo, Colleen taking first place when it was all said and done.  I was assigned to climb with Eddie, Evelyne, and Andreas at Clamshell – which is where I had requested.  We had climbed there last year and there were a few 5.7s that I wanted to lead again.  I wanted some comfort leads that I felt really solid on.  This season hadn’t started out on solid footing with the routes we encountered at Joshua Tree (5.5 with a roof), nor the super wide 5.6 cracks I keep seeming to find at Vantage, so I just wanted a few solid leads under my belt again.
			</p>
			<p>
			We woke up about 6AM on Sunday and packed up, hitting the road at 6:30AM to meet at the Snow Creek parking lot by 7AM.  I hopped in Eddie’s car and we drove about 30 seconds up the road and parked in the area I thought was by the trail to Clamshell.  I walked up the trail just a little and decided it was the one – confirmed by some of the group passing by on the road as well.  After a short hike in, maybe 10 minutes, we were at the crag.  We grabbed our gear and headed up to the right side area with two 5.7s, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.mountainproject.com/v/noisy-oyster/105869882%E2%80%9D">Noisy Oyster</a> and <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.mountainproject.com/v/shrimp-salad/105869873%E2%80%9D">Shrimp Salad</a>.  Evelyne lead Shrimp Salad first and belayed Andreas up, while I took Noisy Oyster.  I like Noisy Oyster.  There’s a tree that makes a great first piece (I love slinging trees), and a crack that takes gear fairly well that provides the occasional foot jam with lots of features on the face.  The crack peters out to slab where a couple bolts are in place to offer protection.  That leads to the ledge with bolts for an anchor.  Eddie followed up no problem, cleaning the gear as he went.  Evelyne and I had hoped to talk about cleaning the anchor but without chains to rappel down, we decided to walk off.  I knew the left side of the area had at least one set of chains so we decided to talk about it then.  Once down we switched routes and I lead Shrimp Salad, a very wide crack at the bottom with little protection.

			I slung the old root again (yay slinging things!) and found a few good cam placements.  On my way down I unclipped the rope from the bush but forgot one more cam on the traverse over so rope drag was a bit annoying.  After Eddie figured out how to get out of the very wide crack and onto the face, he flew right up the route.  He lowered down to climbers left so that everyone could top rope <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.mountainproject.com/v/keep-clam/105869878%E2%80%9D">Keep Clam</a>, a 5.8 on the face.

			I had done it already so I just belayed Eddie up.  He picked up the rope and headed to the left side of the crag to throw a top rope down on the 5.9, <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/forty-four-fifty/105981203%E2%80%9D">Fourty-Four Fifty</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			After grabbing some food I made it up to the area just in time to see Evelyne start her lead on <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.mountainproject.com/v/clamshell-crack/105981198%E2%80%9D">Clamshell Crack</a>, 5.7.  The beginning and end sections are by far the hardest of the climb.  I think the beginning is the crux, but it takes a while to figure out how to finish as well.

			Evelyne got through the beginning and cruised up to the tricky exit corner.  After figuring out where she wanted to place her hands, she easily pulled up and onto the ledge.</p>

			Evelyne moved the top rope over one more anchor that was more directly above the 5.9, and Eddie took a turn on that.  After the nice slabby start, he made the mantle and worked his way up into the crack to complete his first 5.9 outside – well done!  I had cleaned that route last year so instead of doing it again and possibly pumping myself out a little, I decided to wait and lead Clamshell Crack.  Andreas cleaned it but left the anchor, so then it was my turn to lead.  I spent some time at the beginning trying to get a couple pieces in to protect myself, so that I could get through the tricky moves on top rope as much as possible.  After finally finding a couple pieces I liked, I started up and made it through without falling.  I made my way up the crack and was soon to the base of the top section.  After a few more pieces I had made my way to the tricky corner.  I placed one piece low, stood up, and started figuring out where to put another piece to protect the exit move.  Evelyne had said her cam was right where she wanted to put her hand, so I checked out the hand jams until I figured out my strategy and placed a #2 cam.  As I went to pull the move I realized that my plan wasn’t going to work and thought I might actually want to put my hand where the #2 was, so I placed a #1 just a little lower and took the #2 out.  In the end, after starting and stopping a few times, I found a great undercling that I liked.  I was able to work my feet up using that, get a good hand jam, and step onto the ledge to reach the anchor.  Eddie followed up quickly, and once at the top, we walked over to the chained anchor so we could walk through the steps of cleaning an anchor and rappelling down.  Eddie successfully did that, so after both rappelling down, we joined Evelyne and Andreas.

			Our next and final challenge at Clamshell was the 5.8 <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.mountainproject.com/v/58-cube-crack/106165686%E2%80%9D">Cube Crack</a> on The Cube.  It has a difficult start followed by a nice crack.  Eddie and Andreas both gave it a try but backed off.

			There was a group of boulderers in the area that were intrigued by the route.  They figured out the start by sinking a couple nice hand jams, and then cruised up the crack with a few pads below – ballsy guys!  After they all gave it a go, Evelyne tried next.

				<span class="caption">Evelyne getting the start of the route with a good hand jam and a mantle</span>

			<p>
			She found the nice hand jam and was able to work her feet onto the face with a mantle on her left hand.  She was into the crack and made easy work of it.

			Andreas and Eddie, being great sports, both tried the route again.  Finally it was my turn.  My hand was a bit too small for the nice jam so I elected a lie back start on the crack to work my body up high enough.  Thanks to Evelyne’s friendly belay, she kept my progress and after a bit of sitting in my harness and swinging over, I was able to get myself into the crack to finish.  I threw the rope down and Andreas and Evelyne helped catch me as I dropped off the edge of the cube.
			</p>
			<p>
			We packed up and walked up the road just a little to catch the trail to Playground Point.  We had a couple more hours before we had to meet in the parking lot so we wanted to get a few more routes in.  Evelyne and Andreas did some sport slab routes, while Eddie wanted to get a mock lead in so we went to Zap Crack, a 5.6.  I was going to walk up and throw a top rope down but decided to lead it after getting to the start.  It was not what I expected.  It was a slab climb with a wide flare of a crack filled with dirt and sand to protect.  After lots of gardening I was finally able to place a few marginal pieces and made it to the top.  I bypassed the bolts and set an anchor up on the tree just back from the ledge.  Eddie lowered me and I cleaned the route as I went.  I transferred all my gear to Eddie and he was off.  He did pretty well, finding what gear placements he could.  He picked the best ones in the areas he could in my opinion.  We pulled the rope and walked back down to the start.  We packed up and joined the others, and it was time to head back down.  We got to the parking lot right at 4, and of course had to wait for the last crew to roll in.  After the debrief we headed into town and got dinner at the new sausage stand.  It was good but I think the old stand is my favorite.  It was a good day of climbing in Leavenworth, and I got the leads I wanted in – plus a couple.
