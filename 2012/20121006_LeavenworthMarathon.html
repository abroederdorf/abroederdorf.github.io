			Apparently I decided I needed another activity in my life - and somehow that became running?  I'm not sure when it started exactly.  I used to run back in middle school, until I had breathing issues and instead of making that better decided it was just easier to stop running after three years.  I enjoyed cross country - running through forests and around lakes - but I wonder if that was just my need to be in the mountains manifesting itself in the flat lands of the Midwest.  Kevin signed up for the Mercer Island half marathon this past March and tried talking some of us into running it with him.  I opted to just join in some of the training runs and thus started running again - sort of. I started at the beginning of January with the new year and stopped in early February when life got busy.  In April, Aaron and Matt signed up for the Leavenworth marathon and started training.  Seeing as I'm the slowest approacher in the history of climbing, I thought running might be a good way to get myself in better shape.  Attempt number three at making this running thing stick.  I decided to head back to Minnesota with Aaron during the first week in July, which happened to coincide with the Midsummer festivities, including the St. Urho 5K and 10K races.  Aaron asked if I'd be willing to do the 5K, and needing a goal to get myself running regularly, I think I surprised him with picking the 10K.  6.2 miles didn't seem unreasonable and made making a training plan seem more acceptable/necessary.  With a race chosen, I went to Runners World and signed up for the free account so I could access their Smart Coach training plans, the same tool Kevin had used.  His training plan seemed pretty reasonable so I figured the tool would give me a good start.  I started training </span>for the 10K on </span>May 3 with a 2 mile run.  I quickly learned that I live on a hill, and more importantly learned heading north down towards Greenlake had a less steep uphill home than heading south through Wallingford - guess I'd be seeing a lot of Tangletown and Greenlake.  Luckily, I'd occasionally run after work along the Duwamish river trail before the BCC lecture so I'd got a break from the hills then, and slowly started seeing myself get faster - well, marginally.

			My second three mile run occurred during my second week of training, towards the beginning of May when it was relatively warm compared to the prior few weeks.  I basically died, stopping several times throughout the run.  I thought, oh crap - the 10K is in the humid Midwest in July, I'm not going to make it.  I definitely run, or at least feel better when running, in cold weather.  Yes, I'm freezing but I can breathe at least.  Aaron and I decided to hold off on registering for the St Urho 10K until closer to the actual race, so that I could change my mind to the 5K if I was too intimidated.  Towards the end of May I figured it was about time I got a real pair of running shoes, instead of running in the random shoes I had bought a couple years prior because they had blue.  Off to Road Runner I went with the crew and did the whole analysis thing to figure out what sort of shoes I needed.  I walked out with a pair of Brooks, with some blue - of course.  I had gotten an armband case for my phone so I could track my runs with MapMyRun and I had legit running shoes, things were getting serious. Sara started occasionally joining me on my runs around the beginning of June, about a month into my training and just in time for my first 4 miler.  June 21, Aaron and I finally registered for the 10K.  I had been training for it so I might as well give it a go.  I figured worst case I just do the 5K the day of if I didn't think the 10K would go well.  Aaron made it sound like a pretty easy going race so switching shouldn't pose a problem. Throughout June my goal was to finish my runs with about a 9 min pace if I could, and I succeeded with my 6 miler the week before the race, coming in at an 8:53 pace.  Of course for the actual race my goal was to finish, and doing it in an hour would be nice.  Matt had been plotting to get both Sara and I to convince each other to run the Leavenworth half marathon.  Now that I had almost two months of a steady training under my belt, I considered it.  Also, I needed a new running goal for after the 10K if I expected to keep up my new running regime.  Sara and I finally gave in and signed up for the Leavenworth half marathon July 2.  We were stuck now.  I had a new training plan ready to go, building on the running we were already doing which meant we'd bypass the month of 2 milers and just continue at the 4/5/6 milers while building up to a long run of 10 miles before the half.

			The forecast for Minnesota looked hot, especially compared to what I was used to in Seattle.  Aaron and I both had a 3 mile run scheduled for the Wednesday we were in Minnesota.  We got in super late the night before so after sleeping in a little, we got running about 10AM.  Unfortunately that meant it was already pretty hot out, so I started slow.  We ran at about a 10 min pace and I was dying, it didn't instill any confidence for the 10K so I was still considering changing to the 5K.  I found out Vicki was planning to run the 10K as well, at about a 10 min pace so I thought I'd give it a try and run with her.  The course passes right by the cabin so my back-up plan was just to stop there if I wasn't feeling it.  I woke up Saturday morning and had some apple juice along with some fruit snacks.  Morning runs are tricky for me when I haven't had all day to fuel and hydrate.  I decided to stick with the 10K since I could run with Vicki.  The 10K group was much smaller than the 5K, 37 runners compared to 358.  We started at slightly different spots in town as the beginning and end of the courses aligned.  We got out on the main road just a little before the 5K runners came screaming past us. We were making steady progress and soon were passing the cabin - decided I wasn't going to bail after all.  Soon after that there was a water station at about mile 3 so we grabbed some water and continued on.  The course so far had mainly followed the road, with a quick detour down a dirt road along some cabins, and then down the dirt road to circle Stocking Lake.  The trail around the lake was actually really nice, mostly on grass with a couple hills in the trees up dirt.  Vicki had warned me about that section but we made it ok.  Soon we were back on the dirt road, running past the last of the cabins before heading back out to a main road and into town for the last mile and a half.  There was one more aid station about mile 5 that we grabbed water at.  They told me when I turned the corner, I should start my kick to the finish line so I did just that.  I passed the gang at the corner just before crossing the finish line, glad to have finished.  I just missed my time goal with an official time of 1:02:14, but that was good enough to win my age division!  I beat the one other girl in the 20 - 29 female division.

			After the fun in Minnesota it was back to my regularly scheduled running.  Unfortunately the first week Sara started officially training for the half marathon, she was plagued by horrendous shin splints.  A few weeks off and PT found her doing some 30 min runs finally towards the middle of August.  Unfortunately that meant I was hitting the pavement on my own and was soon finding running by myself all the time got kind of boring.  I started listening to music, and on occasion, Aaron and Matt were kind enough to let me tag along and slow their pace way down.  I had been running primarily around Tangletown or Greenlake, while the guys tended to run elsewhere.  I joined them on a six miler around Lake Union and had a lot of fun.  The company was nice as was a change in scenery.

			Luckily I had a fun event planned in mid July with Alicia and Melissa, the Warrior Dash.  It was more about the mud than running though.  We finished the 3.5 mile course in a blazing 54:16, but we had fun doing it!  It was interesting being in an obstacle course based run with so many people.  It took a half mile before we had space to even run a little, and there was generally a bit of a wait at the obstacles.  We climbed walls, scaled cargo nets, jumped over fire, and somehow made it through the mud pit of doom that literally sucked everyone in.  The only other fun run planned throughout training was the Seattle 10K.  I signed up for it with Aaron, Sara, Matt, Kevin, and Lindsey but skipped it in the end to head back to Chicago for Zoë's bachelorette party.  The rest of the crew did great though - maybe next year I'll try again.

			Mid August saw an increase in the intensity of the training plan to four runs a week, as well as my first true long runs starting at 8 miles and building up to 10 miles.  For my first 8 miler I did a combination of routes taking me around the zoo and Greenlake to stay somewhat close to home as I was running by myself.  It was the longest I had ever run and I felt fairly good at the end.  It was a different kind of run for me.  I didn't care about speed or time, rather just went into this long run mindset with my music on and enjoyed the time.  I decided to have a Gu before the run and had a good energy level throughout, so I made that a staple of my pre-long run preparation ritual.  Sara was trying to work her way up to the long runs so she'd be ready for the half marathon, as she was still intending on running it.  For my second 8 miler, Aaron ran with me as did Sara. Coming off the 10K, Sara was working her way up with a 7 miler so Aaron and I just did an extra mile out and back.  We ran east on the Burke Gilman towards the University, trying to find a flat route to reduce strain on shins.  Getting into the long runs was kind of fun, planning routes through various parts of the city.  I had followed Matt and Aaron on their 16 and 18 mile runs via bike to help provide them food and water (moving aid station), so that gave me more ideas of where I could head myself.  For the third 8 miler, Sara and I did an out and back on the Burke Gilman heading west this time, towards the locks.  The best part of that run was discovering the Kickin' Boot whiskey kitchen in Ballard - they serve some tasty bbq!  We got a week off before the 9 miler.  Aaron and Matt had a 10 miler that week so we combined forces.  I found a route that went out around Portage Bay and Lake Union.  It's always nice running around Lake Union because of the water fountain at the south end of the lake.  I never did bring food or water on any of my runs which was nice, not having to carry anything extra.  I came up with a few 10 mile options.  Sara and I decided on one that started from Gasworks and headed west along the ship canal trail, down the Elliott Bay bike trail, through Lower Queen Anne to Lake Union and back to Gasworks.  It's kind of amazing how much ground you can cover on long runs, and how much of the city you can see.  With a good 10 miler under our belts, we were down to the week of the race.

				<span class="caption">Post Leavenworth Marathon and Half Marathon</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Wildfires had been sparked near Leavenworth the second weekend in September and were still only about 50% contained.  The race directors were in contact with the registered participants and tried to come up with options for those who wanted to opt out for health concerns.  We had gone out to Leavenworth the weekend before for the BOEALPS fall campout to do some rock climbing.  While it was smokey and we could see the Cashmere fire from our campground, it didn't seem all that bad.  Besides, we had been training for months and all of us wanted to run our race - and not wait for the hillier Seattle (half) marathon option at the end of November.  Personally, in the final weeks as we neared the half marathon, I was ready to be done running.  I was looking forward to running the race and getting a break from a four run a week schedule to get back to my normal schedule, like rock climbing a couple times a week.  In addition to the smoke, Sara also got sick the week of the half marathon - it was going to be an uphill battle.  The forecast for race day was in the mid 30's for the start of the half.  I hadn't run in cold weather like that since middle school!  I decided to run in a thin long sleeve shirt and shorts, with my sunglasses and phone to track us.  Sara was starting to feel a little better by Saturday and was determined to run the half, so I left my headphones behind in anticipation of having a running buddy.  We parked about 20 minutes before race time and got ready, trying to stretch in the cold and stay somewhat warm.  They started the race about 10 minutes late, so I was glad when we finally got going.  There was a huge group running the half so I followed Sara as she started making her way through the crowd.  We weaved in and out, passing people for the first 3 miles.  We were running fast too, about a 9:30 pace.  About 4 miles in we hit the town and soon entered the park.  The dust from the trail pretty much made it impossible for Sara to breathe with the smoke and illness so we finally started slowing down a little.  We skipped the first aid station at 3 miles but grabbed water at the second one about 5/6 miles in as we were exiting the park.

			My favorite part of the race was all of the spectators along the course. People who sat at the end of their driveways cheering us on, and the little kids giving out high fives.  It was a fun environment to run in.  About mile 7 Sara wanted me to take off so she could run at her pace.  I was planning to run with her, and had no intention of ditching her especially when she had about 25% of normal lung capability.  We hit another aid station about 8 miles in with Gu and Powerade.  I grabbed both but unfortunately got one of the Gu flavors I don't like.  Oh well, I was hungry and needed something.  We took the up hills easy on the out and back side streets, walking parts.  At 10 miles we were both setting personal records for the longest runs we've done.  My hip flexor was bothering me a little so I asked Sara if she'd carry me the last few miles - that was a no go.  We left the road and headed through the hatchery, finding another aid station at about mile 11 in the trees.  We grabbed some Powerade and got ready for the final miles.  We crossed the bridge and could see the finish line, unfortunately we still had a two mile loop in front of us.  Of course they couldn't make the final two miles easy either, it was a sandy trail with small rolling hills throughout.  In an effort not to pass out from lack of oxygen (much appreciated) Sara decided she'd walk a bit of the final mile, and then we'd start running when we got to the bridge and could see the finish line.  During the beginning of the race Sara was planning to do a heel kick at the finish.  I figured I'd be so spent, I'd probably just fall on my face - amusement for the spectators at least!  As we neared the end, she decided against that plan, but during the last stretch I just barely heard her say kick as she was trying to get air.  After a moment I realized she didn't mean she wanted to kick, as in run faster, but rather do the heel kick. I gave it my best effort as we crossed the finish line.  Success!  Not only did we finish the half in just under 2:30, official time of 2:28, I didn't fall on my face during the heel kick!  We quickly made our way over to the nearest patch of grass so Sara could rest/get some air, while I found some Powerade.  Eventually we found the rest of the crew, grabbed our t-shirts, and hit up the delicious post race food.  I couldn't get enough red vines.  In the end, everyone did really well!  Aaron and Matt both exceeded their goal of running a marathon in 4 hours, by coming in at 3:53.  Luke beat his goal of 1:30 on the half marathon, coming in at 1:28.  And a couple other familiar faces, Scott and Dana, were both big winners, Scott won the half and Dana won the half for his age group.  We enjoyed the rest of the weekend, relaxing at the house, getting sausage and beer in Leavenworth, and finally checking out the Reptile Zoo just outside of Monroe by the School Bus BBQ.

			Even though I was really looking forward to getting the half over with and stop running, my mindset changed post race. In preparation for the half, I had run 292 miles over 71 days. I realized that had gotten me into somewhat decent running shape and I didn't want to lose it.  Also, I felt kind of lazy if I wasn't doing something.  Apparently I'm going to keep this running thing up.  I got some warmer clothes for running in the cooler weather, as well as a hat to keep the rain out of my eyes.  Next up, probably another half next Spring. Eying the Wenatchee half in April, but the Mercer Island half in March could be another possibility.  After that, I somehow got talked into the Tough Mudder in May so that'll be very interesting.  We'll see how my running enthusiasm wanes during the winter, but until then, I guess I've added yet another activity to my regular schedule.
