			<h1>BCC Guye Peak 3.25.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			The second BCC team outing objective is navigation.  This takes most teams to the Commonwealth Basin at Snoqualmie Pass.  The peak assigned to THE Objective Hazards was Guye Peak.  This would be my fourth trip up Guye – my first one was as a BCC student, the second was my first year instructing, and my third was in January when I did the South Gulley route with Aaron, Aaron, and Ambrose.  At least I knew the peak and route well.  The forecast for Sunday was not very cheery so I expected the worst.  Josh and Tricia picked me up at 5:40 at my place (what service!) and we made it to the pass by 6:30AM to gear up and get ready for the climb.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the pass with clear skies – we could see our objective from the parking lot!</p>

			We left the parking lot a couple minutes before 7AM and found the staircase that had been cut into the unusually large snow bank along the road.  We found the highway system of trails and started off.  We took one break to let Sarah’s team pass us on their way to Red Mountain, and continued on our way.  We stopped several times to let the students work on their navigation.  They figured out what elevation we were at, took bearings from Guye and Kendall, and learned to recognize the peaks.</p>

			We were moving fairly well, definitely aided by the highway system of trails and the steps from the Saturday team.  We found the log crossing and passed right on by as the snow was piled up precariously high.  Josh, Tony, and myself ran ahead to try and find a suitable snow bridge across the creek.  They finally found one and Charlie talked about crossing snow bridges.  Once on the other side we continued following the trail and soon came to the second creek crossing with another nice snow bridge.</p>

			Now it was time to go up.  Our next destination was the saddle between Guye Peak and Cave Ridge.  We found some steps which made it nice and started up.  We still had pretty clear views of the surrounding mountains and I even applied sunscreen for the second time of the day – the weather was pleasantly surprising me.</p>

			We made it to the saddle, and started up the last bit to the north summit of Guye Peak.  The steps were a bit large but we made our way and soon arrived near the north summit.  I was going to help lead across to the middle and south summits to set fixed lines for the students to cross, but once we saw the route we decided against it.  There was an extremely large cornice overhanging our route and with the sun up and water dripping off of it, we deemed it too dangerous to have anyone below it if it gave.</p>

			Josh, Matt, and Mike set to putting a fixed line up to the north summit – mostly so that the students could get some practice traveling on a fixed line.  At the same time, Tony, Devin, and myself started scouting the peaks to see if we could find a different route to the middle summit.  Devin went on lead to see if there was enough snow to traverse off the north summit but it was a little dicey.  He spotted another possible route down at the base of the north summit so I belayed him from there as he placed some pro.  He made progress but decided the route over to the middle summit was a bit exposed for the team and headed back.  At least we gave it a go!</p>

			Charlie helped the students create a bollard and talked about it, letting a few students test it out as an anchor.  The summit treats were plentiful!  Girl Scout cookies, string cheese, peeps, and pastries – the team did great.</p>

			The weather was starting to blow in so after we got a team picture, we packed up to head down.  On the way down, Tony demonstrated glissading and somersaults.  Jackie was the only student brave enough to try the somersaults but I’m sure more will in the future.</p>
			<p>
			Somersault videos on the way down: <a href="http://youtu.be/tLuN81AQwpE">Devin</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/I-sn8wvV16k">Danika</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/1P1dFBjPWoA">Jackie</a></p>
			<p>
			We started down the trail and followed our steps back, crossing the snow bridges and soon finding the trail highway.  We were back by 4PM so we stopped just before reaching the road and worked on some skills, heading back to the parking lot right at 5PM.  A stop at Jay Berry’s in North Bend afterward for some delicious food was a great way to end the day.  My Guye Peak Stats include reaching all three summits on two attempts, and reaching just the north summit on the other two attempts.</p>
