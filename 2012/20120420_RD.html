			<h1>R&D 4.20.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			It’s April which can mean one thing – Tulip Festival! Well that and the more exciting annual BOEALPS spring campout in Leavenworth.  As soon as I got home from Vantage over Easter weekend I was looking forward to my next weekend of climbing in Leavenworth.  Sara and I decided to take Friday off and climb R&amp;D, hopefully at a less crowded time than we figured Saturday would be.  Monday the weather forecast wasn’t looking great for Friday with a 50% chance of rain.  For once the weather forecast changed throughout the week went in our favor and soon it was 30% chance before 11am.  We decided to take our chances and still head out early.  I picked Sara up at 8am Friday, about the same time the guys were leaving, and we started for Highway 2 with a stop at the Sultan Bakery for some delicious breakfast with the guys.  Half a breakfast sandwich and quarter of a breakfast burrito later, we were back on the road.  The rain of the morning had given way to overcast skies and fog while we hoped for some improvement as we headed over Stevens Pass.  We were soon winding our way towards Leavenworth with sunshine overhead.</p>

			We pulled up to R&amp;D about noon and were excited that the rock looked mostly dry.  We saw a few more of our friends at the start of the route – Brandon, Aaron N, and Theresa.  We had actually run into them at the Bakery that morning, they were just leaving when we arrived.  Sara and I pulled our gear out and got ready by the car as the other team started up with Brandon leading.  At least they were the only other group on the route and some familiar faces nearby.  Sara was going to take the first and third pitch so that she could challenge the chimney once again, so I would take the second and fourth pitch with the triple crack system.  We had climbed R&amp;D the year before at the campout with Matt and Aaron, although I just followed as I had only gotten my first trad lead the night before.  It was cold, we wore our big puffies the entire time, it was super crowded, and I was certain that I was going to be blown off of the wall in the triple cracks as the wind was quite strong.  There was a wind again – great, I’d deal with it when I got in the cracks.</p>
			<p>
			I made a quick pit stop before we got to the start of the route.  As I was about to head back to the trail I noticed a bear off to my right.  I yelled to Sara to let her know and I just stood still looking at the bear, then quickly grabbing my camera for some pictures.  Soon I noticed a cub joining her and got a bit nervous so I hurried back to the trail.  As I was heading back Sara saw a second cub – we didn’t want to mess with a mama bear before our climb.</p>

			We continued up to the start and flaked the rope, ready for when the team ahead of us was up the first pitch.  Brandon took the straight variation, basically combining pitches 1 and 2 of the traditional climb.  Sara and I were going to try and stick more to the traditional route, so she headed climbers right across the slabs after making it through the first little step.</p>

			<p>
			Unfortunately rope drag was terrible so she didn’t get to make it up the ladder of a crack to the nice big belay boulder.  Instead she found a nice crack and built a gear anchor to bring me up.  We had decided to bring my radios on a whim and were glad we had.  They fit perfectly in our OR wind jacket chest pocket and made communicating throughout the climb so nice – especially considering the river, wind, and other people on R&amp;D that makes it a rather noisy place.  I soon reached Sara, grabbed the remaining gear, and started up one small crack, passed the big belay boulder, and up another short crack to the slabby-wandery bit to set up another belay.</p>

			Brandon was just finishing setting up another belay at the base of the chimney so I took the rock they had used and quickly brought Sara up.</p>

			The theme of the first two pitches was running it out – Sara and I are champs at that.  Sara started up the third pitch that would end above the chimney.  She started up the blocky crack system, and soon found herself below the chimney on some wet rock.</p>

				<span class="caption">Sara leading the third pitch</span>

			<p>
			After figuring out the best way across and up, she was soon above the chimney and setting a gear anchor.  As she was leading up, a solo climber stopped by me to wait to pass us.  As soon as Sara radioed down that she was off belay, I let her know he was heading up and then I started breaking down my anchor.  At the same time Bill appeared looking to build an anchor to end his first pitch and bring Mimi up.  After a quick picture I was on my way up.</p>

			I made it up to the base of the chimney, made my way across the slick rock, and found the hidden flake on the left side of the chimney that basically makes it a face climb.  I was soon out of the chimney and exchanging gear with Sara so that I could take the fourth and final pitch.  I started up on the ledge below the triple crack system.  I still haven’t found a graceful way onto that step but I made it.  I finally plugged a piece in at the base of the triple crack and started my way up.  It was a bit windy and I wanted to move through that section as quickly as possible.  As I was standing on the nice ledge half way up the crack, I could see the giant jug up and to my right, I just had to get a little higher to reach it.  After some jams it was within grasp and I was past the triple crack.</p>

			I made my way across the next ledge into the last, right arching crack that would lead me to the top.  After getting up past the first step on that, I plugged a few pieces of gear in and reached the final little slab section.  Once past that Sara let me know I was out of rope – within probably 10 or so feet of the belay boulder I was heading to.  Brandon, Aaron, and Theresa were on top so I handed my cordelette to Brandon to sling the boulder as Sara broke down her anchor and made her way to the base of the triple crack for a few feet of simul-climbing.  Once there I had enough slack to reach the boulder and get a comfortable belay position to bring her up the rest of the way.  Before long Sara appeared at the last slab step, finishing R&amp;D.  After a couple of quick pictures we were ready to head back down.  I had a great day on R&amp;D, everything went pretty smoothly.  It was a nice little warm-up for the climbing season.</p>
