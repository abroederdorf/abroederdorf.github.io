			<h1>Lopez Island Bike Ride 5.26.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			The first long weekend of the year was upon us – Memorial Day Weekend.  The climbing to-do list for the year is quite long and this would be our first post-BCC free weekend so we wanted to take advantage of it.  Aaron has been eyeing Prusik in the Enchantments, and trying to beat the permit season starting June 15, we decided to do that.  As Memorial Day neared though, that plan was rethought.  Sara and I had been up Mt Rainier on an attempt at the summit the weekend before and in general, I was ready for a bit of a break following BCC.  Unfortunately putting Aaron’s prized climb on hold, we decided against the 10 mile hike into the Enchantments for the weekend.  Now we just had to figure out what to do instead.  A road trip down the coast into Oregon was mentioned but the forecast was marginal.  We were looking for some of that aloof sunshine for the weekend.  I started thinking about a bike ride and looked at the San Juan Islands.  The forecast looked great on Saturday so we picked Lopez Island, the least hilly of the San Juans.  The Seattle Bicycle Club even had a <a href="http://www.seattlebicycleclub.org/members/maps/lopez_island_scenic_37.pdf">route</a> set up.  After doing a bit of research and reading, I decided we should do the loop around the island clockwise, to end up in Lopez Village for dinner before heading back to the ferry.  Plan was set – we’d catch the 10:35AM ferry in Anacortes to Lopez Island.  We’d bike clockwise around the island with stops at Spence Spit State Park, Shark Reef Sanctuary, and Lopez Village before heading back to Anacortes on the 5, 7:10, or 8:25PM ferry.  I also looked at some <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/ofNh">cutoffs</a> that would reduce the 36.5 mile ride to 13, 23, or 27 miles depending on how we were feeling along with a few extra parks to stop at if we felt so inspired.
			</p>
			<p>
			Friday night Aaron helped me adjust my seat and topped off all the tires with air.  Saturday morning, Matt and Sara rode over by 8AM to get the bikes loaded on our new bike rack and head for Anacortes.  We were right on schedule, hitting I-5 a couple minutes before 8:30AM.  Traffic was decent for the holiday weekend and we made good time – good thing because the line for the ferry in Anacortes stretched well over a mile from the terminal.  After a quick debate, it was decided to park in one of the nearby neighborhoods and bike to the terminal to bypass the long line of cars.  We found a spot, grabbed all the gear, and down the hill we went.  There were several other cyclists with the same idea.  We stopped outside the building with the tickets and had maybe 10 minutes to spare before they started loading the ferry – perfect timing.

			We walked our bikes on the ferry, tied them up on the car deck, and went and found some nice seats for the 30 minute ride to the island.  It was a gorgeous day with sunshine and blue skies.  We had a great view of Mt Baker (also on the to-do list). </span></span><span>Before

			<span>We gathered in the little parking lot at the terminal with the rest of the cyclists, and then started up the hill.  It had probably been a good 9 months since I last rode my bike so I was trying to quickly shake off the cobwebs.  I wasn’t quick enough and couldn’t get into a lower gear before hitting the hill so Matt stopped with me and helped me adjust things so I could make some progress.  Finally we were on the road, trying to catch up to Aaron and Sara ahead.  At the base of the hill we took a left on Port Stanley Road to head for Spence Spit State Park, our first stop of the day.  The island was a great place to ride.  Not much traffic, everyone waves, and beautiful scenery often times riding along the shore or through rolling hills with distant mountain ranges in view.

			About 4.5 miles into the ride we arrived at Spence Spit State Park.  We locked our bikes up and hiked down to the spit for a picnic lunch.  The beach was a driftwood playground, so after enjoying some sandwiches, fruit roll-ups and cheese puffs, we were off playing on the beach.</p>

			There were a lot of shells in the sand, and after grabbing a great piece of drift wood, we each took a little batting practice on the beach.</p>

			We had many more miles ahead of us so we started out again, heading south along the island.  We took Port Stanley Road to Lopez Sound Road to School Road and we planned to regroup quick before continuing down Center Road.</p>
			<center>
				<a class="example-image-link" href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SX9VFoumtA0/T8HK5s7mz3I/AAAAAAAAeu8/aiZ6rJoGj0w/s800/P5260046.JPG" data-lightbox="allPics" data-title="Quick break to regroup after a challenging hill along School road"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SX9VFoumtA0/T8HK5s7mz3I/AAAAAAAAeu8/aiZ6rJoGj0w/s400/P5260046.JPG" alt="Quick break to regroup after a challenging hill along School road"/></a>

			The Island was a nice ride but had its occasional challenging hill to head up.  We stopped at Center Road before a couple of the cutoff options to see how everyone was feeling and where we wanted to head.  We decided to stop again at Vista road along Mud Bay Road to see if we wanted to do the lower southeast loop on the island or just head straight for Shark Reef Sanctuary.  Center Road is probably the busiest road on the island but still not too bad.  We made decent time and were soon heading up a hill right past Vista Road.  We stopped near a nice farm field and strategized.</p>

			If I was going to do the loop, I wanted to stop at one of the two parks down there, or I’d head back to Vista and continue to the Shark Reef Sanctuary.  We decided to send the boys on the loop via Aleck Bay Road (to burn off some extra energy) while Sara and I cut down Mackaye Harbor Rd to Agate Beach Park.  Sara and I had just found nice rocks (one in the sun and one in the shade) on the beach when the boys were walking down the steps.  The view from the beach was very pretty.</p>

			No driftwood there, just lots of rocks.  I had another fruit roll-up and after everyone had some fun throwing rocks into the water, we headed back to the bikes to continue on our trip.</p>

			We headed back up to Mud Bay Road and this time took a left onto Vista Road.  Some more nice small, windy roads through the farms eventually brought us to Richardson Road, to Davis Bay Road, to Burt Road, and finally to Shark Reef Road.</p>

			The bike racks were pretty full but we found just enough room for ours and Sara started running down the trail to the bluffs.  We found a nice spot along the rocks and sat for another break.  Aaron and I grabbed the small boxes of wine with our sippy cups and enjoyed some cheese puffs.</p>
			<center>
				<a class="example-image-link" href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-D_MxEieql5Y/T8HLMa8Z1ZI/AAAAAAAAeyM/RJ147v_Trp8/s800/P5260101.JPG" data-lightbox="allPics" data-title="Cheese and wine break"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-D_MxEieql5Y/T8HLMa8Z1ZI/AAAAAAAAeyM/RJ147v_Trp8/s400/P5260101.JPG" alt="Cheese and wine break"/></a>

			We checked out the map, about 10 miles back to the ferry with a dinner stop about half way.  We didn’t see any seals (sad) but the view was spectacular.  The Olympic Mountains faintly to the south, a light house across the way, sunshine, and blue skies with a few seagulls around.  It was about 4PM and we figured we should get going to grab dinner and try to make the 7:10PM Ferry.</p>

			We headed back up Shark Reef Rd to Airport Road to Fisherman Rd.  We even saw a bald Eagle soaring above some of the fields on the way.  I had looked up a couple restaurants beforehand so we stopped to check one out on Fisherman Bay Road, but after talking to some of the people decided to head into the Village.  We found the Love Dog Café and decided to eat there, outside on the porch under the lavender to enjoy the nice weather.</p>

			They had some delicious seafood specials, so I enjoyed some salmon, rice pilaf, and asparagus for dinner followed up by some chocolate dessert Aaron was eyeing as soon as we entered the café.  Full and happy, we set off to conquer the last 4.5 miles of the day.</p>

			We continued through the village and 10 seconds later (it was tiny) were on our way up Lopez Rd to Military Rd to Fisherman Bay Rd to Ferry Rd.  Maybe I was just really tired but there were two very challenging hills in this last section, although the coasting was really nice.  The final hill to the ferry was killer but once I crested I was determined not to pedal again.  Aaron and I made it to the start of the car lines and walked our bikes down to the terminal.  We had about 25 minutes to spare before the 7:10PM ferry, great timing.  We all sat in the little shelter until called for our ferry.</p>

			It was decided the boys would ride back up to the car in Anacortes and come pick Sara and I up as our butts were done with biking for the day.  We walked up hill with our bikes until we saw the Jeep heading our way.  After a couple minutes the bikes were back on the rack and we were headed home.  I had a lot of fun on my first real bike ride.  It was a great way to enjoy the beautiful day with friends and check out Lopez Island.</p>
