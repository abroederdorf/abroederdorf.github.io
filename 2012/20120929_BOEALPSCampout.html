			<h1>Leavenworth: BOEALPS Fall Campout 9.29 - 9.30.12</h1>
			
			<p>The BOEALPS fall campout was in Leavenworth again, although this year there was the added twist of the wildfires.  The wildfires had been sparked a couple weeks prior during a lightning storm and were unfortuantely still burning strong nearby Leavenworth - both the Table Mountain and Wenatchee fire complexes.  We checked the fire and smoke related reports, read some recent trip reports from the area, and decided to still head out.  Part of the motivation was to see just how bad it was to figure out if we would still be running the Leavenworth marathon and half marathon the following weekend.  The fire didn't deter too many and the campout still had a great turnout.  As we drove into town, we could see the haze from the smoke, but it didn't seem too bad outside.  As we were finishing dinner at Ducks and Drakes, Bill and Mimi walked in. The group site at Bridge Creek was locked so they had to come into town to get cell phone reception to call and get the code.  They shared the code with us as they wanted to get dinner before heading back to camp.  After a quick stop at Safeway to get food and drink, we arrived to the locked gate at the campground.  Apparently we were the first ones there with the code.  There were a few cars parked nearby with sleeping BOEALPers as we didn't get there until after 9.  We opened the gates and everyone scattered throughout the site to set up camp before sauntering down to the campfire location, sans campfire.  With the wildfires burning all over the state, there was a burn ban in effect.  Luckily the moon was super bright and it was fairly warm for late September so we hardly missed the campfire.  We could see the fires on Cashmere mountain burning from camp though.

			<p>Aaron had decided to set up some rock climbing seminars for the Fall Campout, so Saturday morning he took the top rope group with Mo while I took the sport leading group with Alex, Joe, Jeff, and Alyssa.  Both groups met at the turnout for Playground Point at 7AM.  We went over some basic skills at the cars like gear requirements, picking climbs, clipping technique, anchor review, and general leading concepts.  Aaron had built me a bolt board so we could show and practice clipping on the ground which was really nice.  After about an hour, we packed up and headed to Playground Point.  Jeff lead Baby Steps (5-) while Joe belayed him and talked about lead belaying.

			<p>After that, pairs of students split up with an instructor and went off to lead things.  Students were on <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/baby-steps/106582034">Baby Steps</a> (5-), <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/hopscotch/106582181">Hopscotch</a> (5-), <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/aisle-of-sky/106904386">Aisle of Sky</a> (5.6), and <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/romper-room/106582024">Romper Room</a> (5.8+).  Everyone went over cleaning the anchor as well before gathering for a quick debrief just before 11AM when we headed back to the cars.

			<p>The top roping crew rejoined us from Barney's Rubble and Bruce's Boulder where they had spent the morning climbing as well.  Overall I think the seminars went pretty well.  After the seminars we went back to the campground to grab some lunch and regroup to figure out the afternoon plans.  Aaron had found Hammerhead on Mountain Project, and since none of us had been there before, we decided to start the afternoon there.  It was about 10 ft from the road so a great approach with a few, short routes right there.  Aaron geared up to lead the <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/59-crack/106165758">5.9 crack</a>, Mo geared up to lead the <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/56-dihedral/106165717">5.6 dihedral</a>, and Alyssa walked around to the top to drop a rope on the <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/510a-arete/106606417">5.10a arete</a>.  Mo flew up the 5.6 dihedral, so we had Jonathan follow.  It was his first day outside rock climbing.  He had taken the top roping seminar that morning so we decided to continue his rock climbing education by sending him up after Mo to clean the route.

				<span class="caption">[Left] Mo leading the 5.6 dihedral at Hammer Head. [Right] Jonathan following Mo on the 5.6 dihedral, pulling gear for the first time</span>
			</center>
			<p>Aaron battled his way up past the two bulges on the 5.9 to put up that route, which we all took turns top roping.  The top bulge was definitely challenging.  I used a lieback until I could kick my right foot out far right and find a better finger pocket up top to use as I mantled to get myself up.

				<span class="caption">[Left] Mo just pulling past the first bulge on the 5.9 crack at Hammerhead. [Right] Mo trying to work her way past the crux bulge, the second one</span>
			</center>
			<p>I also decided to lead the 5.6 dihedral and placed a whopping 3 pieces - it may have been a little run out.  Finally I got on the 5.10a arete on top rope and carefully smeared my way up that.  Overall it was a fun little area and you couldn't beat the approach.
			</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Jeff top roping the 5.10a arete at Hammerhead</span>
			</center>
			<p>Next, we decided to head back to Barney's Rubble and Bruce's Boulder.  Neither Jeff or I had actually climbed at Barney's Rubble so Matt and Aaron went there with us while Mo, Alyssa, and Jonathan went across the street to Bruce's Boulder.  We were in lazy approach mode so those two areas were the next best option for the day.  Jeff got on the <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/58-crack/106630552">5.8 crack</a> while I lead the <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/56-crack/106630563">5.6 crack</a> and placed 4 pieces this time.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">[Left] Jeff leading the 5.8 crack at Barney's Rubble. [Right] My lead on the 5.6 crack at Barney's Rubble.</span>
			</center>
			<p>After that I wrestled my way up the wide 5.8 crack to follow Jeff's lead and clean it.  I used a lie back to get up the initial wide section - great on top rope, not so much on lead.  The only real plan we had going into the weekend was to get on Classic Crack.  Apparently it was a travesty that I had never climbed it so that needed to change.  Aaron planned to lead it and then heckle everyone as they top roped it, while enjoying some lime-a-ritas so we planned to make it our last objective of the day.  When we arrived at the rock there was a whole group already there waiting for us to arrive.  They all wanted to get on <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/classic-crack/105793864">Classic Crack</a> (5.8+) but no one wanted to lead it.  I found a great log to sit against and watch people climb.  Aaron grabbed 6 pieces and direct clipped them during his lead.  He quickly made it up the route and lowered back down, so everyone could take turns climbing.

			</center>
			<p>Luke, Chris, Bill, Fedya, Jonathan, and Mo all went up before it was finally my turn.  Matt had picked a nearby log to belay from using Aaron's grigri while he looked through the guide book.  I started up and fell out of the crack as my tape glove ripped off my hand.  The crack was a bit wide and I was mid forearm deep.  I wrestled my way up, not making it look pretty in the slightest, ripping the tape glove off one more time.  I topped out and lowered down to let Matt climb and clean it so we could head back to camp and join the potluck.

			</center>
			<p>Bill and Mimi had brought pulled pork which was delicious, as well as all the other food people brought to share.  It was a little cooler Saturday night so I got my new blue, fuzzy monkey fur fleece, my lion hat, and wool mittens.  Alyssa and I made a quick trip to the water too for making hot chocolate, mmmm. 
			</p>
			<p>Our plan for Sunday was to get breakfast at Kristall's and then figure out where to climb.  The guys were interested in going somewhere new, i.e. somewhere not along icicle creek.  We decided on Clemm's Holler and started the caravan down Highway 2, pulling off in the second turnout on the right, just fitting all of the cars.  We had a pretty big crew heading up there.  After a bit of an approach, much more so than Saturday, we arrived at the rock to luckily find it open.  People spread out and started leading.  Sasha got on <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/gun-rack/105921065">Gun Rack</a> (5.9), while Chris did the first pitch on Honky's Lament (5.8), Matt and Luke did <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/nettlesome/105794275">Nettlesome</a> (5.9), and Fedya and Levi did <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/playin-possum/105794282">Playin Possum</a> (5.8).

				<span class="caption">Fedya leading Playin Possom (5.8), climbing with Levi</span>

			<p>The area was really nice as we were in the shade and there was quite a bit right there to climb.  After taking pictures of the leaders, I made my way over to Gun Rack (5.9).  The clearly visible crux was pulling over the roof up high.  I made my way up, following the bolts, and got myself just below the roof.  There is a really nice flake to hang off of, but I needed to work my way over and up to reach the hold in the roof.  I first made a bit of a dynamic move to try and grab the jug.  I got my fingertips on it but couldn't hold on.  I worked my left foot up a little higher and got the jug this time, as I started searching around for a good right hand hold.  I finally found it up the corner a bit in the finger crack and was able to pull myself over the roof.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Aaron making his way towards the crux roof on Gun Rack (5.9)</span>
			</center>
			<p>After that, I got on the first pitch of Honky's Lament (5.8).  It had an interesting first ledge to get on to start the climb.  It was fun to see all the techniques to get up it - I used a combination of mantling and beaching myself but I got up it.
			</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Aaron employed a heel hook with mantle to get on the ledge</span>

			<p>Honky's Lament was a fun climb with some reachy parts that forced me to do a bit of lie backing on the flakes.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Chris leading the first pitch on Honky's Lament (5.8)</span>
			</center>
			<p>Next I went over to Nettlesome (5.9) as Matt and Luke had left a rope on the first pitch when they rappelled down.  It was a nice lead by Matt - a fun, balancy slab climb. 
			</p>
			<center>
				<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MviiHbF_WTGR05GiRXTu-NMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img height="400" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UXVM5PRyQuQ/UGkcP1bF_SI/AAAAAAAAkkA/dbtV3foPqAA/s400/IMG_1732.JPG" width="300" /></a>
				<br>
				<span class="caption">Matt leading the first pitch on Nettlesome (5.9)</span>
			</center>
			<p>Some of the guys were having fun top rope playing on the harder routes in the area, like <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/perils-of-pauline/105794030">Perils of Pauline</a> (5.11c).  Finally I took my turn on the first pitch of <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/poultry-in-motion/105794216">Poultry in Motion</a> (5.10c).  I watched a few guys head up it and it looked like a bit of a reachy climb.  I decided to give it a go, warning Jeff I may ask for a friendly belay.  This route shared the start of HOnky's Lament before heading up and right, so I got to test my method of gaining the ledge again.  I think the second time was a little more mantling and a little less beaching - hopefully.  The initial move to get on the face was interesting and challenging (reachy) but I figured it out eventually, and then continued up trending right.  As I was told, when in doubt, go right.  Just before the top, where the cracks had petered out and there were only crystals to stand on, I finally asked for a friendly belay.  I just couldn't quite reach the next seam without it.

			<p>After everyone had done a lap on the routes they were interested in, we pulled the ropes and packed up in the early afternoon.  We headed back into town to grab food at the Munchen Haus sausage stand, my favorite one, and then took off for home.  Another great weekend of climbing in Leavenworth, even with the wildfires burning nearby.
