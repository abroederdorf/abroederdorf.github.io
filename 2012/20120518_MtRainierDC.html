			<h1>Mount Rainier - DC Attempt 5.18 - 5.20.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			One mountain in particular looms above everyone in Washington – well, when it’s out.  It especially hangs over the head of any local climbers.  Kevin, Sara, and I decided it was time to take it off the list – we were heading for Mount Rainier.  Based on our commitments as instructors for the Basic Climbing Class, we decided the May 19th weekend would be our best opportunity.  We had our team graduation climbs the week before and would be missing trail maintenance. We were hoping to head up via the Ingraham Direct route, although it’d be a gamble if it was still in.  We started tentatively planning early in 2012, mostly trying to identify the rope teams.  We were hoping for two rope teams but based on our climbing styles, finally settled for just the three of us.  We applied for camping permits by the end of March deadline, with our plan of camping at Muir the first night and Ingraham Flats the second night.  We were hoping an extra night at elevation would help us acclimate and give us a better shot at making the summit.  A reservation was probably not necessary for an attempt early in the season, but might as well since we knew that was our weekend.</p>
			<p>
			We received our climbing permits and camping reservation in early May and decided we should start planning for real.  None of us had a 4-season tent so we decided to borrow a Northface VE-25 from the club.  I contacted the gear focal to get that lined up.  Next we figured out group gear and a tentative itinerary.  Sara would bring wands, we’d both have a GPS, I’d bring my radios, and Kevin and Sara would each bring stove/pot/fuel.  All of us were planning on bringing a picket and avy gear, and I’d bring my 60m 8.9mm rope.  Luckily last minute we were able to snag Matt’s 47m 8.9mm rope to shave off a pound and a half.</p>
			<p>
			Our itinerary was:
				<ul>
					<li>Friday, May 18, 5:00AM: Leave Seattle</li>
					<li>Friday, May 18, 8:30AM: Leave Paradise parking lot</li>
					<li>Saturday, May 19, 7:00AM: Wake up, pack up, and leave Camp Muir</li>
					<li>Sunday, May 20, Midnight: Summit push, leave Ingraham Flats</li>
					<li>Sunday, May 20, 10:00 AM: Turn-around from summit push, to put us through Cathedral Gap by 2:00PM</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			As Friday neared, we sent our climbing plans to our emergency contacts and started the process of packing. Packing Thursday night put us all within a pack weight of 43 – 47 lbs.  It’d be challenging making our way up to Ingraham Flats.</p>

			5AM Friday morning showed up sooner than desired, and I drug myself out of my warm bed.  Sara and Kevin met at my place to load up Kevin’s car and head for the park.  We made great time even with a breakfast stop in Puyallup and were registering at the climbing information center at Paradise by 8AM.  The rangers informed us that the guided groups had switched that week from the Ingraham Direct (ID) route to the Disappointment Cleaver (DC) route.  The one ranger had been up Tuesday and said if you strayed from the boot pack and did a little route finding, you could avoid the crevasses fairly easily on the ID.  We had planned on doing the ID, but were also planning on having company nearby on the route in case something went terribly wrong, so we were rethinking our decision.  We figured we’d talk to people at Muir and decide as we saw the routes.</p>
			<p>
			It was snowing at Paradise – our streak of three weekends of beautiful weather was over.  We grabbed our packs and finished gearing up in the tunnel near the bathrooms at Paradise.  Kevin parked his car in the lower overnight lot and finally we were off.  Team Sexy and You Know It started from Paradise about 8:35AM for our first attempt on Mt Rainier.  I was moving nice and slow but was feeling pretty good.  The mountain was mostly shrouded in clouds but every so often they would break just long enough for us to get a hazy peak at the summit.</p>

			<p>
			 It was pretty quiet around there, being a Friday morning.  A couple of guys passed us right before we reached Panorama Face.  There was a decent boot pack leading up from Paradise but Pan Face was full of steps everywhere, and it was hard to find a nice boot pack to follow.  Finally Sara got it and Kevin and I slowly followed up behind.</p>

			The bathroom at Pan Point was completely melted out along with large sections of rock.  We took a break as the sun came out and the clouds broke.  I changed into the rest of my sun gear, including another application of sunscreen, and we had some food and water.  Finally we geared up again and took off.  I was feeling a little iffy so we stopped at some rocks again to take a little break just above 7,300’.</p>

			I grabbed some Gu and soon we were off again, heading up Sara’s favorite – the Muir Snowfield. This was the fourth weekend in a row Sara was heading up the Muir Snowfield so she’d probably use different words to describe it.</p>

			<p>
			Our training hike/skin up the Muir Snowfield was three weeks prior on a busy, but gorgeous day.  We made steady progress up as the weather started to improve.  We could see more mountains, including the summit.  We stopped again just over 8,100’ for a longer break.</p>

			Sara took a nap, Kevin had a photo shoot, and I tried eating the remaining part of the half of bagel I failed to eat for breakfast.  Finally I had gotten some food and water down and we were started off again, Flash running up hill with myself and Fire Butt trailing behind.</p>

			Sara stopped at Moon Rocks for our final break of the day just under 9,000’.  As Sara soaked up the warmth of the rocks, Kevin and I took a break to reapply some sunscreen, eat, and prepare for the final stretch into Camp Muir.</p>

				<a class="example-image-link" href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vvZpusgV0GI/T7m8uJZmHPI/AAAAAAAAeIU/KOxtO90C4QA/s800/IMG_1027.JPG" data-lightbox="allPics" data-title="Sara staying warm wearing her buff (old lady look) and stealing the warmth from the sun baked rocks"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vvZpusgV0GI/T7m8uJZmHPI/AAAAAAAAeIU/KOxtO90C4QA/s400/IMG_1027.JPG" alt="Sara staying warm wearing her buff (old lady look) and stealing the warmth from the sun baked rocks"/></a>

			<p>
			Sara started off, eager to reach Camp Muir, with Kevin and me resting another 5 – 10 minutes before taking off.  The upper part of the Muir Snowfield looked a lot like Pan Face – steps everywhere.  I finally picked up part of a boot pack but it was a little slow going.  After we crested the ridge and had Camp Muir in sight, we were back in a good boot pack and it was all about making it to the goal.</p>

			<p>
			I saw Sara reach camp, then Kevin, and I had just a little bit left.  I was moving slow but making progress.  Sara was going to head back down and grab the rope from me but Kevin didn’t let her.  I was determined to make it up with all 45lbs of gear on my back so it’s better he stopped her up high.  I finally made it to the shelter and was delighted to see that Sara and Kevin decided to set up in there instead of setting up the tent for the night.  I was all for not having to break down camp in the morning and do the climb to Ingraham Flats with a wet tent.</p>

			There were a few other groups in the shelter eating dinner as well, planning on a summit push that night.  We figured even with the disruption of them getting ready around midnight, we still would sleep better in the public hut than in our tent.  Kevin and Sara set about to melting snow and boiling water.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Kevin and Sara melting snow</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Sara and I both don’t eat well at altitude so we planned to split a chicken and rice dinner each day rather than carrying around a lot of excess food.  I was having a hard time eating while Sara much preferred her peanut butter M&amp;Ms so we were only able to finish maybe a third to half of the meal.  The other groups were in their sleeping bags ready for sleep to prepare for their summit push, so we got our warm water bottles and also headed for bed about 7PM. I didn’t sleep great during the night.  The other groups were a bit disruptive with a few other teams finding their way into the hut throughout the night as well.  Honestly I would normally very easily roll over and go back to sleep and not think twice about the disruption.  I wasn’t feeling great though and was convinced I’d be heading back down to the cars Sunday.</p>
			<p>
			We woke up about 6:45AM Sunday morning.  Kevin reported a very sunny day and wanted to make our decision of continuing up or turning around sooner rather than later, to make it through Cathedral Gap before the sun warmed the snow too much.  I wasn’t feeling great but of course didn’t want to turn around.  I sat up in the bottom bunk and started eating the half of bagel I had left.  I was able to get that down and it was decided we should head up.  We only had about 1,000’ on the agenda for the day.  We got the stoves fired up to melt some water, while Sara aka Muscles opened all of the frozen bottles from the night before.  As we were packing up a familiar face appeared in the hut – Josh.  He, Levi, and Peter were about to head down from Camp Muir after their successful summit the day before.  They had ended up taking the DC route and said the ID was looking pretty open on their way down.  Considering the rangers’ advice, the fact that the guided groups had switched, and now our friends advice we decided we’d also be heading up the DC for our summit push.  After a quick group shot with them, they headed down as we roped up for our climb of the day.</p>

			<p>
			Seeing as I was in the worst shape and moving slowest, I was put on the front of the rope with Sara in the middle and Kevin bringing up the rear.  We started out from Camp Muir about 9AM as I slowly plodded along.  You can see Cathedral Gap and the 500’ you have to climb to reach it very clearly from Camp Muir.  It involves a slow traverse up.</p>

			<p>
			As we made our way around, we could see a couple of crevasses below us, and a few rocks that had rolled across the boot pack.  There was one area in particular just below the gap where it looked like there had been a lot of rock fall.  We decided to continue plodding along until we reached that area and high tail it through the section.  We could hear rock fall periodically as we made our way across.  When we were within a wand or two of the section, I stopped for one more water and food break, then took off.  At the top of the Gap we took a quick break and marveled at the amazing scenery.  Little Tahoma, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, and Mount St Helens were all visible.  We could even faintly make out Glacier to the north.</p>

			<p>
			We could see a couple guided groups traversing over to Cathedral Gap behind us as we continued along.  We encountered a couple of rocky sections to make our way across, and the switchbacks made being roped up a bit tricky.  The guided groups were catching up behind us and I could use a break, so we stepped off the trail to let them all pass.  They were making a training hike up to the Flats from Muir for the day, in preparation of their summit push on Sunday.</p>
			<p>
			Once they were by I continued my slow plodding and finally we reached the flats about 11AM.  The training groups were sitting near the trail eating lunch.  There was a row of Mountain Hardware tents from a guiding group and another tent (assuming it was the rangers’) a little farther up along the trail.  We could see groups coming down the cleaver and finally had our best views of the route ahead of us.  We spotted an old tent platform and decided to make it work for us.  We unroped and got the tent out.  Our 3 person tent was just a little too big so Sara and Kevin dug the snow wall back a little farther.  We got the tent set up and slowly worked on getting the thing guyed out with snow stakes, as we also laid around and ate some food.  I got a few bites of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich down, and then set about digging a bathroom near the tent entrance.  I didn’t want to have to stumble far in the middle of the night.  Kevin then began digging out a kitchen – a bit close to the bathroom.  This made for some awkward moments later but what would climbing be without those.</p>

			<p>
			We discussed our start time and decided to start an hour earlier at 11PM to give ourselves the best chance of making the summit – despite Sara’s objections of climbing that much longer in the cold.  Sara and Kevin also discussed the possibility of heading up on a two man team in case I wasn’t feeling great in the morning.  They told me I’d be heading up with them, but we all kept the option of me sitting out the summit push in mind, depending on how I felt when the time came.  I had brought a little deck of cards and kite for entertainment, although the time passed by fairly quickly without the need of them.  We wanted to at least fly the kite but there was no wind so I just kind of threw it up in the air a couple of times and pulled it around.</p>

			We figured we’d head to bed about 4PM for the wake-up call at 10PM.  Timing worked out well for Kevin to get some water for his food and to fill our nalgenes for bed.  Sara and I elected not to even try eating the second chicken and rice dinner we had since I had the half frozen one in my pack.  Instead I was able to eat some beef jerky and pretzels, and choked down some chocolate.  Chocolate is much more appetizing to me at sea level.  Sara was still going strong on her bag of peanut butter M&amp;Ms.</p>

			The weather started blowing in and soon we were in a cloud getting snowed on.  Luckily it was just before we were planning to retire to the tent anyways so we packed things up, got as much ready for our summit push, and tried going to sleep.</p>

			I think Sara was the only one that actually got much sleep as Kevin and I tossed in our bags.  The one good thing is that I kept drinking water so I was well hydrated.  I finally fell asleep about 9PM and woke up at 10:45PM – my alarm didn’t go off!  I woke the rest of the crew up and turned on my headlamp in red light mode.  We started getting ready, and since I was actually feeling pretty good, decided I’d be heading out on the summit push.  We had set the rope up the day before, so once we got enough layers on, we put our harnesses on and the crampons, with all the glacier travel fixings.  It was dark, cold, and snowing but we were heading up.</p>

			I started out from camp about 11:45PM, slowly leading the rope up the Cleaver.  As we traversed to the base of the cleaver we came upon the fixed ropes the guide services had set up.  We followed these up and were slowly making progress up the cleaver in weather that was getting colder and windier by the minute.  My water had frozen and there was no good break from the wind to take a break near so we kept plodding up.  I was starting to feel worse and get very cold.  I had my puffy vest on with my big puffy in my pack.</p>
			<p>
			Finally I stopped and Sara and Kevin came up (we were on the cleaver far from crevasses).  I put my big puffy on as we decided what we wanted to do.  The weather was only getting worse as we went up and I wasn’t feeling much better either, so we decided to turn around just after 2AM. I started the group down as we saw the headlamps from the guided groups coming up from the flats.  We were just passed the fixed line at the base of the cleaver when we passed the first group.  We passed probably 6 – 8 groups on the way back to our tent.  I needed some food and water and very badly wanted a nap, so we dropped our gear and curled up in our sleeping bags a little before 5AM.  I stuck my water bottle inside my down vest to hopefully help it thaw.</p>

			About 6:30AM we woke up, Kevin and I being the ones that actually got some sleep.  The wind was howling outside so after some banter back and forth, Kevin finally made a move and headed out to start breaking down camp.  We got the gear packed up, tent disassembled (stakes still attached as the cords were frozen), and roped back up.  The weather was far worse than when we got back to camp a couple hours earlier – good thing we turned around.  We were in a white out with snow and ice pelting us in the face.  I started leading the team down again just after 8AM from Ingraham Flats, mostly keeping my head down but fighting every so often to see where we were headed.  We followed the trail and wands back to the gap and picked up the speed on the traverse around.</p>

			Back at Camp Muir we took off our harnesses and crampons, and I coiled the rope back up.  We could just barely see Cathedral Gap across the way and knew it’d be a fun trip down.  We grabbed trekking poles and our sunglasses and started down the Muir Snowfield in a white out.  Another group was starting down about the same time so they followed us.  My GPS was dying but we checked just in time to see we were headed in the right direction to Moon Rocks.  I had extra batteries but didn’t feel like stopping to change them unless we really needed them.  Basically we just followed Sara down the snow field which she knew well – and had the wands to keep us in check.  The sunglasses proved useless as they were just fogging up and making progress in the white out horrible, so I held them in my hand for the trip down, not wanting to stop to put them away.</p>
			<p>
			Kevin and Sara did a good job of pausing every so often to make sure I was still with them as I slipped and fell in the snow on my way down.  I’m not sure exactly when the snow/ice turned to slush/rain but soon enough we were soaked through.  My hiking pants were soaked, which meant my long underwear got soaked, which meant I had water streaming into my boots via the long underwear/sock transition.  I don’t think I ever wanted to know what it was like descending from above 8,000’ with boots full of water but I found out.  We were basically as miserable as could be on the descent so nothing really matter.  We took all of the slushy glissade chutes as getting more wet was not possible.  I was surprised to see people heading up.  We only passed one or two on the Muir Snowfield, but there were plenty below Pan Point – they must have been crazy!</p>

			We finally staggered into the parking lot.  Sara dropped her pack off in the tunnel and headed to get the car.  I grabbed our climbing registration and went to the climbing center to check out.  I must have looked miserable as the rangers offered me coffee and chai tea.  I signed out, talked a little about our trip, and walked back through the rain to the tunnel.  Sara was just pulling up so we grabbed our happy bags of dry clothes.  We had a competition to see who could pour more water out of their boots – I won at Paradise but Sara had more to pour out in Seattle so I think she took the overall prize.  I had forgotten a shirt but luckily Sara had an extra to share – the dry shirt was worth being a Steelers fan for the day.  We loaded up Kevin’s car and headed away from the mountain.  I was already pretty hungry and as we started back the others soon were too, so we decided to stop before reaching Puyallup and grab dinner at Bruno’s in Eatonville.  Our first attempt on Rainier didn’t quite go as planned, but a good experience and some lessons learned for Team Sexy and You Know It’s next attempt.</p>
