			<h1>BCC Devils Basin Overnight 3.31 - 4.1.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			For the overnight outing, Team 6, THE Objective Hazards, was assigned Devils Thumb and Devils Peak.  It would be the first time snow camping for many of the students.  I love snow camping, but this weekend would end up being my least favorite camping experience so far.  I was excited to head up to Devils Basin off of the Mountain Loop highway as I had never been before.  My only close experience was to Gothic Basin for my birthday and from that I knew it was a cool area.  The weather forecast leading up to the weekend was bleak.  A big storm was blowing through the mountains so we expected a lot of fresh snow to wrestle with.  Worse than that, the forecast called for snow with a high of 37 – 40 degrees during the weekend – I guess some would call it snow at that temperature?  Regardless, I tried to prepare for a wet weekend.  Josh and Tricia picked me up again and we met the rest of the team at the Verlot Ranger station at 6AM.  Team 2 was climbing the same peaks so they met there too before heading to the trailhead.  The group gear (tents, pickets, ropes) was distributed at the ranger station and then we drove to the ‘trailhead’ (the road) to finish gearing up.  The road (NF-4052) was closed at the mountain loop highway with just enough plowed to act as a mini parking lot.  We were in for a long road hike ahead of us.</p>

			Team 2 was leaving just as we were parking so they were ahead kicking steps that we gladly followed.  After turning onto the old logging road, we encountered an old road starting to get covered with trees and bushes.  The snow wasn’t too deep but there were plenty of holes and tree branches people found along the way.  There were several ditches and a few creek crossings as well.</p>

				<span class="caption">Road hikes are my favorite - NOT!</span>

			<p>
			At least the rain at the ranger station had turned to snow, although it was a wet snow.  The first part of the hike was actually fairly warm – I took off my mittens and hat, had my coat as unzipped and open as I could while still battling the falling snow.  The trail emerged from the trees just long enough for us to get some views of the nearby mountains – including The Big Four.</p>

			Finally we reached the first switchback and caught up with Team 2.  We took a break to tend to some needs, and then continued on.  Instead of following the road to the next switchback, we cut up the hillside through the trees.  We followed the steps Team 2 kicked and we soon emerged on the road again, for yet another switchback.  After heading up road just a little bit to avoid the denser brush near the stream, we headed uphill again.  This time we diverted from Team 2’s tracks and kicked our own steps, which involved navigating on our own as well.  We were soon in a little clearing and wallowing up a steep slope in snow.  After some discussion we headed down just slightly and around to real estate under trees with more favorable snow.  We continued up, forging our own trail, occasionally seeing the steps from the other team.  We found a good snow bridge for the creek crossing and continued in the trees.</p>

				<span class="caption">Heading up through the trees</span>

			<p>
			We were making our way up towards the basin by following the creek.  I was surprised how big some of the trees were in that area, the trunks were huge.  We once again found ourselves wallowing in an open area on a fairly steep slope.  Josh powered up and we followed.  A moat prevented us from going up one section into the trees so Josh traversed further and powered up another steep section.  After we crested that, we continued traversing along through the trees.  We were getting closer to the basin with the slopes rising up around us.  We found Team 2’s steps again and took them up the final steep section, landing us at the avalanche crossing.  The crossing was quite long to hurry across.  The team did great though.  As we sent Gabe first, some snow up higher started sloughing a bit showing just how serious this crossing was.  Once everyone got across, it was just a little further until we came upon Team 2 setting up camp.  We got to camp about 2PM.  Team 2 had taken most of the really good spots by trees so we spread out a bit in search of our own trees.  The wind had really picked up so we were trying to find any coverage we could.</p>

			Danika and I found a couple of trees, made our platform, and set up the tent.  I had borrowed Aaron’s EV2 four season for the weekend.  The students had two 4 person Trangos that they worked on.  Tony and Mike set up close by and Matt and Josh found a nice hillside to dig a snow cave in.  It was decided that we wouldn’t try for the summit of Devils Peak as it was late in the day.  Instead, we decided to build a giant igloo.  The thought was that it could serve as a giant group kitchen since the tents were spread out so much that we couldn’t really do a group dinner, and the igloo would help get us out of the weather.  We stomped out a quarry and Mike worked on creating a base for the igloo.  As the students finished setting up their tents they came over and helped.  I was cold and my hands were frozen so I finally gave in and put my giant puffy on and got one of my two remaining pairs of dry gloves out (I had two soaked through already).  People took turns with the snow saw cutting blocks, prying them up with shovels, carrying them over and placing them, and filling in the holes in the wall with snow.</p>

			It was taking shape but being such a large endeavor the progress was slow.  Team 2 returned to camp after their summit push.  They got within 400 feet of the summit but had to turn around due to time.  At least there would be nice some steps for a summit push on Sunday.</p>
			<p>
			It was about 6PM and everyone was hungry so work stopped on the igloo and everyone went to their tent to get the stoves started for melting snow into water for cooking and water bottle replenishment.  I grabbed my Jetboil and started melting water for Danika and my dinners.  She had lasagna and I had my usual chicken with rice.  After getting water for the dinners I melted more snow for our Nalgenes.  It was a great idea to get some warm Nalgenes for sleeping that night.  Right as I grabbed the stove the weather actually cleared up and we saw some blue sky and sun.</p>

			It was a really nice view and we could see the moon already.  After finishing melting water, Danika and I went to bed.  I was ready for the warmth of my sleeping bag and to call it a day.  I put my puffy around my feet to keep them warm, so I was really happy to have the warm water bottle to cuddle with.  I curled up in my sleeping bag, closing it over my head to trap my warm breath.  I got up not long after we went to bed and while it was dark out, the moon lit up the surroundings.</p>

			In the early hours of the morning I woke to a strong wind and blowing snow.  The plan was for the students to wake us at 5AM to get ready for a summit push.  We’d carry the ropes and get everything ready so that Team 2 could also summit behind us – our thanks for the steps they had kicked.  Tricia came over at 5AM and through the wind and snow we heard her ask about the summit push.  It was quickly decided that the weather wasn’t optimal for that so we went back to sleep for a couple hours with the intention of waking up at 7 and packing to head home.  At 6:45AM there was a bit of a break in the wind so Tony woke everyone up and we slowly got ready.  A lot of snow had fallen throughout the night and we had some sizeable piles starting around the tent.  We shook the tent from the inside and finally emerged.  Danika found our buried packs and ice axes.  We got all of our gear packed up and then it was time to collapse the igloo.  Some of the blocks were knocked in and the entry way was covered.</p>

				<span class="caption">Lots of snow fall overnight buried the gear left outside.  Sprinkles was very snowy/icy</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We started down, trying to find out tracks from the day before which had almost been completely erased.  We had to kick steps through the snow on the way out as well – it would be slow going.  We made our way back across the traverse through the basin and started down, following our tracks pretty well.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Our tracks were pretty filled in from the day before</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We made it down the steep slope Josh had powered up the day before, and started down through the trees.  Team 2 caught up to us in the trees, so when we finally reached the first switchback they passed us.  The students got some more practice plunge stepping through the trees until we reached the final switchback.  We had a long road hike ahead of us and boy was it long.  Soon the rain started and my fourth and final pair of gloves were done for.  I took them off finally after we had turned back onto the final road from the old logging road.  After more curves than I wanted to count, we saw the road closure gate and arrived back at the cars.  Everyone was a wet mess and we couldn’t wait for the dry, cotton clothing awaiting us in our happy bags.  After a little snafu with getting the car from the trailhead, we were eating in Granite Falls at the pizza place.  Everyone had survived the weekend and while we didn’t have the most pleasant conditions, I think everyone learned a lot – especially what weather not to go climb in.  Hopefully we’re getting the bad weather out of the way for better days ahead!</p>
