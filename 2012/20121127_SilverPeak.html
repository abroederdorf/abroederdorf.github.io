			<h1>Silver Peak 11.27.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			Aaron and I were keeping an eye on the 10 day forecast.  My birthday was fast approaching and I was hoping to get out to play in the mountains the weekend before, either skiing or climbing.  On Monday when we were looking, the last non-rain day in the forecast happened to be Tuesday so we made plans to call in sick and head to the mountains.  I've been wanting to get a few more Tatoosh summits checked off my list, but the Mount Rainier National Park decided to close the road from Longmire to Paradise on Tuesdays and Wednesdays starting that Tuesday, so that was out.  We looked at Snoqualmie Pass next.  I still need to tag Red Mountain and Lundin in the Commonwealth Basin, but assuming we'd find more people who'd want to do those we decided on Silver Peak, a peak both Aaron and I had tried during BCC and had failed to reach the summit.  The plan was hatched and I was excited to take advantage of a mid-week nice day to head out into the mountains for an early birthday climb.

			Aaron and I left Seattle about 6:30AM so we'd make it to the trailhead in time for sunrise.  We knew we'd be fighting the clock with the limited sunlight this time of year.  After a quick pit stop in North Bend, we made it to the snow free trailhead to find one other car in the Annette Lake trailhead parking lot.  We geared up and hit the trail.  It was a bit cool but soon I was moving well enough to warm up a bit.  I wore my mittens and hat the whole day, but was good without any jackets on the trail.  We discussed our turnaround time, figuring 2PM would be good.  It would give us enough time to get back to the trail by sunset around 4:30, and we could follow the trailhead out via headlamp if we had too.

			We passed many waterfalls along the trail, and before long hit the snow.  The trail was boot packed snow which made it a little slippery and I had to slow my pace.  Luckily I had my trekking poles to help me from falling too many times as I slipped up the trail.  Aaron had taken a different way during his attempt than I had, up through the trees to the ridge lower down, so we decided to follow my initial approach which had us heading up from the trail closer to the lake.  In my reading, I saw that there was a climbers trail marked from the lake with cairns.  As the terrain flattened along the trail, I knew we were getting close to the lake.  Not ever having been to the lake, we decided to follow the trail all the way there and see if we could find the climbers path up.

			In about 2 hours we made it to the lake and took a left, soon finding the climbers trail marked with orange and pink ribbon.  After a quick Gu break, we headed up.

			I had worn my mountaineering boots while Aaron had on his backpacking boots.  The snow was pretty icy so I lead up, kicking steps best I could.  We followed the ribbons up and soon made our way out of the trees onto the base of the mountainside.  A few more ribbons and some cairns led us up.

			After about 500 feet of that, I wanted a quick break to get some more Gu and put a jacket on as the wind was quite cold.  Aaron was going to kick steps for the next section but after seeing how hard the snow was, decided it was a good time to break out the aluminum crampons we had brought with us.  We were sure glad we brought them as it made the climb up a lot better/faster.  Aaron started traversing back and forth up the mountainside as I slowly followed him up.  The sun was out and the views were fairly clear.  We soon spotted Annette Lake below us.

			I took over lead again and made it up to the ridge.  Aaron scouted out the summit and realized we had a bit of a traverse ahead of us to get around to it.  He started leading out again as we carefully made our way around.

			The snow was very icy and it was hard to get purchase in areas.  Aaron stopped on a small rock field to wait for me, before we tackled the last couple hundred feet up to the summit.

			<p>
			Just below the summit ridge we did a little high dagger to make it up the last bit over the icy terrain.  It was nice that the scree was covered, but it was probably a little early in the season for a good snow climb.  We made the summit about 12:30, a little over 4 hours from when we started.  The wind was brutal so we took pictures at the top and were soon headed back down, just wanting to get back to the trail.  I wanted off the icy slopes and out of the bitter wind.

			We followed our tracks back.  The sun made things a little softer but still good cramponing conditions.  We made great time back, taking a steeper route down than we did up so we had to traverse a little less.  We kept the crampons on all the way back to the lake where the terrain leveled again.  We found someone had set up camp at the lake as we made our way to a great sitting log for a bit of a break, to take off our crampons and get a little something to eat.

			After a nice break in the sun, we were off again.  The slick trail made the going down just as slow as the going up, as it's always more challenging to go down things.  I fell a couple times but we made it back to the dirt, and hurried back to the car.

			We made it down just after 3PM, plenty of time before sunset and decided to stop in Issaquah at the brew pub for some dinner on the way home.  Despite the icier than expected conditions, it was a great day out in the mountains for an early birthday climb with Aaron, topped off with a successful summit.
