			<h1>Mount Thomson - West Ridge Attempt 9.22.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			Alex and group were looking for a fourth climber for the West Ridge of Mount Thomson (commonly also spelled Mount Thompson), and I jumped at the invite.  Other than seeing the peak from the top of Kendall Peak last January and someone telling me that's what it was, I didn't know much about it until Sara and Matt headed in to climb it in July.  It looked like an interesting peak, and I obviously wanted to get out in the mountains, so Alex's invite was perfect.  Joe and Steve would be the other two climbing, a fun group.

			The weather forecast early in the week was still looking like summer so it was decided everyone would bring in bivy gear - it'd be my first time bivying.  I was bringing the rope and radios while Alex was bringing the rack.  They were already planning a nice, relaxed two day climb, just my style.  We would head out from the trailhead about noon on Saturday, camp at Ridge Lake, and then be moving by 6AM on Sunday to climb the West Ridge and get back to the cars.  As the weekend neared, the weather forecast turned a bit south.  Using NOAA and finding forecasts for basically the same area but at different elevations (~4300' and 5200'), I saw some bad things moving in.  One forecast called for 20% chance of thunderstorms Saturday, including that night, with sun/smoke on Sunday.  The other forecast was showing partly cloudy on Saturday with a 30% chance of rain Saturday night and Sunday morning.  Joe e-mailed out the crew early Saturday morning to see if anyone changed their minds.  No one did so I figured I'd go along for the adventure, even with the dismal forecast. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I picked Steve up just after 10:30AM and we headed for the pass.  I figured that would give us some time to gear up and in my case, lather on the sunscreen.  As we drove out we hit some pockets of light rain - no good.  This would be my first trip to the Commonwealth Basin when it wasn't covered in snow.  I actually got to drive up to the trailhead and park there.  I didn't understand the snow free parking lot with the toilets easily accessible.  The parking lot was fairly full and we were still shrouded in clouds.  Steve was hoping we might get above them at the pass but no luck.

			Joe and Alex soon arrived so we got ready, ate a quick lunch, and hit the trail.  Looking at the topo map, you can still see the old trail through the Commonwealth Basin.  We decided to take this and meet up with the PCT later, in hopes of knocking a mile and large switchback off the long approach.  It was suppose to be about 7.5 miles to Ridge Lake via the PCT so I welcomed the shortcut.  Steve started out leading since he knew the way.  Just out of the parking lot, we took a left on an overgrown trail.  It was easy to follow, I just wasn't used to all the trees and brush that lined it, which normally are under snow when I head in during the winter.  It wasn't raining per say, but all the leaves were wet so we got a bit wet as we trudged up the path.  We were definitely walking through a cloud too.  Before long we approached the log crossing - with absolutely no snow, weird!

				<span class="caption">Log crossing sans snow</span>

			<p>
			We crossed that, kept along the path, and soon came to the next little stream crossing.  Steve and Joe both picked their way across the rocks.  Alex had almost made it across when the last rock she stepped on rolled underfoot and sent her splashing into the stream.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Second stream crossing that claimed Alex as its victim</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			She was ok, picked herself up, and found a nice log to sit on while she unzipped the bottom portion of her pants, wrung out her socks, and tried to dump the water out of her boots.  Another ominous sign, but Alex shook it off and we kept on going.  Too bad the sun wasn't out to help dry things.
			</p>
			<p>
			Not too much farther and we hit another trail across a small rock side wall with a sign pointing left to Red Mountain, so we took a right and soon intercepted the PCT where we took a left.

				<span class="caption">Found the first junction with the trail to Red Mountain.  We took a right to head to the PCT</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			There was a sign near that junction on the PCT pointing out the Commonwealth Basin trail.  Now we started encountering people on the trail as most had stuck to the PCT.  We hit the second major switchback on the PCT and continued up.  Still our view was of the cloud we were in, even though I knew we should be able to see Guye Peak and Red Mountain.

			<p>
			A bit father up, in the trees in a nice flat spot with some good logs for seats, we took a break for some gu and water.  Alex set off in the lead from there and took us across the talus slope traverse just below the summit ridgeline.

			I still had the summer mindset, thinking it was August but this trip quickly changed my mind.  Back to crummy weather, but I was pleasantly surprised by the fall colors along the trail.  The berries were ripe too.

			<p>
			Steve pointed out the trail to the top of Kendall peak, a well worn climbers trail that heads up hill just beyond the old, dead stump.  We made it to the view point and took another break.  My heels were starting to feel a little bothered so I figured I'd preventatively tape my heels to stop any blisters from forming.  Soon after we were heading across the Katwalk, my first time up there.  It was cool, but a lot wider than I expected.  Without snow at least, just another trail to cross.  The white cloud surrounding us made it a little weird though if you just stared out into it, so we kept an eye on the rock.

			<p>
			After passing through the Katwalk, the weather deteriorated even more.  A steady mist/light rain started.  I contemplated getting my pack cover out to help keep the rope from absorbing water and increasing my load, but everyone seemed hopeful it would pass so I continued along.  The mist didn't let up, and as we approached Ridge Lake it got worse.  We were protected from some trees along the trail while we could see the mist/rain blowing across it in waves just up ahead.  I dropped my pack to get my pack cover and rain jacket out - a couple items I decided to add in the last minute with the gloomy weather forecast.  I was glad I did!  We talked about our options - stay the night, if the rock is wet, we could make it out for breakfast in the morning (I was already talking up the River Bend Cafe).  Stay and hope the rock is dry and get the climb in, or head home and grab dinner at North Bend Bar and Grill before sleeping in nice, warm beds for the night.  My vote was the nice, warm bed, not looking forward to sitting in the wet and bivying.  I didn't see the weather improving to dry the rock either.  That became the concurrence of the group.  Since we were at the lake, our intended destination for the day, we took a few minutes and walked around as recon for a future attempt.

			<p>
			It was a nice lake with some good spots for camping.  Steve walked all around the lake and found 5 tents set up - a few people sticking out the weather.  After fueling up on some peanut butter M&amp;Ms, courtesy of Steve, I started leading the group back to the car.  It had taken us just under 3.5 hours to reach the lake, so we expected 2.5 - 3 to get back out.  Once past the Katwalk again, the weather died down and the blowing mist/light rain disappeared.  That was nice so I could lower my hood and warm up the hands.  We didn't encounter many people on the way out but made steady progress.  We stopped a little before the shortcut again to refuel a bit.  I had finished off my 4 Gu's and pack of shotbloks already.  I wasn't expecting to be hiking out so I had packed the rest of my food away and didn't want to grab it out.  Needless to say, I was hungry by time we made it back to the cars.  We had no issues finding the shortcut on the way back and a  bit after 6PM, arrived in the parking lot.  We quickly changed out of our wet clothes and hit the road to the North Bend Bar and Grill.  We ran into Rick, Jason, and friend who coincidentally were also attempting the West Ridge that day.  They had made it to Bumble Bee pass by noon and couldn't see the mountain, so they went back and scrambled up Kendall instead, so we missed them on the trail.  Oh well.  Despite the weather, it was nice to get out in the mountains and get a bit of exercise in.  I chalk the trip up to some recon for my next attempt on Mount Thomson!
