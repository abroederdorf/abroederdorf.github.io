			<h1>Black Peak - Northeast Ridge 7.28 - 7.29.12</h1>
			
			<p>
			My last mountain adventure had been a month and a half ago when we did our one day Dragontail-Colchuck extravaganza.  Every weekend I was either cragging due to bad weather in the mountains, or missing the lovely weather due to vacation or people visiting.  It was the graduation climb weekend for BRC, but seeing how nice the forecast was and getting tired of hearing me whine about not getting to go play in the mountains, Sara agreed to climb Black Peak with me.  When I made my list of climbs for the year Ingalls was first, followed by Black Peak and those were my two main objectives.  We had planned to try Black Peak in mid June, but due to weather opted for the Dragontail-Colchuck one day adventure instead.  Extra bonus was that it was an off week for the ICC too, so Ben and Chris joined us so we'd have two teams climbing together - reunion of Team Belay-Off!</p>

			We planned a relaxed two day climb to give ourselves plenty of time - mostly because I'm the most painfully slow approacher in history and then we wouldn’t be rushed.  We planned to leave Seattle at 8AM and stop for breakfast in Marblemount.  We anticipated 4 hours to camp and then a full day of climbing the next day.  After reading the recent trip reports we could find, we weren't entirely sure if we'd be camping on snow or not.  Looked like some of the route was melted out (yay talus fields) but there was still quite a bit of snow around Wing Lake, our intended camp location.  We packed the tent and rain fly since we don't generate much heat ourselves, and I had my 10 deg bag, little puffy, and down booties.  For the first time ever, Sara and I would have to share a tent without anyone else - weird.  
			</p>
			<p>
			We geared up at the Rainy Pass trailhead and hit the trail about 12:15PM.  It was nice and sunny out and I had a lot of gear in my big pack.  The first part of the approach was along the Maple Pass Loop trail, my favorite hiking trail.  We'd split off at Heather Pass and drop down to Lewis Lake, before heading back up to Wing Lake - all the while Black Peak would be looming in the distance.  Ben and Chris move a lot faster than me and were soon out of sight.  Sara would stop every so often to make sure I was still trudging along.  It was a low energy day and I was struggling more than I would have liked along the trail.  After some good views of Ann Lake we were heading up a few switchbacks before reaching Heather Pass.</p>

			We took the first trail/boot path we saw - not knowing a better trail was about 10 feet ahead.  Luckily they all met up in the meadow as we came over the pass and we got our first glimpse of the weekend target - Black Peak.  This reenergized me a bit as we started down towards Lewis Lake.</p>

			Ben and Chris had taken a more roundabout way to find Heather Pass so we bumped into them again and started across on the traverse with them.  There was quite a bit of talus with some snowfields mixed, but eventually we found our way down to the trail.  When that trail would disappear in the snow, we'd just keep traversing along until we could reach another little island of earth with trees and trail.  The guys really started taking off around Lewis Lake, right when I really needed a break.  It was hot out and I needed water and food, so Sara stopped with me as I sat and recuperated a bit.</p>

			Finally I was feeling better so we started around the lake.  The lake was a gorgeous color with some ice still floating in it, although mostly melted out.  We made our way through the trees and found the trail up again, heading up a few snow patches in between the trails.  I was surprised at how wet everything was.  We passed lots of waterfalls and many times the trails acted as streams.  I guess I should have known better with the high temperatures and snow melt.</p>

			I was dragging again so Sara would stop every so often to let me catch up, before taking off again.  Finally I saw Chris over a ridge and figured I was close.  They had their tent set up and were hanging out when I reached the lake about 4.5 hours after I started.  There was a fairly large snow free patch right at Wing Lake so we set up camp there.</p>

			It was a little tight for two tents but we made it work - the vestibules just weren't very helpful.  Immediately we met the neighborhood goat, who was named Edgar during the weekend.  He was a big guy but seemed mostly non-aggressive, just annoyingly comfortable poking around camp.</p>

			Once Sara and I got our tent set up, we started boiling water for dinner.  Wing Lake was still mostly ice covered but the edges had started melting out so we had access to water, we just had to treat it.  I had my usual chicken and rice and actually got through about 2/3's of it.  After dinner (thanks to Ben and Chris for finishing up our dinners), I brought out the peanut butter chocolate bars to have a mini birthday celebration for Ben.  He was a great sport and even wore the birthday hat!

			<p>
			After that we cleaned up and planned for the next day.  Sara and I could either both bring packs and just climb in them since it'd be like two leaders while simul-climbing, or have one pack so that the actual leader could more easily access the gear.  After much discussion and debating back and forth, we decided to bring Sara's pack.  I'd gear up and wear my harness up, while wearing the rope as a backpack while she had the pack with our crampons, rock shoes, jackets, food, water, and other miscellaneous items.  We put everything else we were leaving behind in my pack to hang in the tree while we were away.  Since Edgar was so friendly, we found some good spots in the trees to hang our packs.  I found a great tree I could get a good foot jam in so I could reach up a little higher - hopefully out of Edgar range.  We pulled everything else in the tent with us so that Edgar couldn't chew on our boots.  We settled into our tents for the night, and after a few more snacks (I was apparently hungry?) fell asleep with the alarm set for 6AM the next morning.</p>

			Woke up in the morning and slowly started getting moving.  I had actually stayed warm enough just in my sleeping bag during the night and didn’t wear my puffy or booties – who would have guessed?  After eating some breakfast and lathering up in sunscreen, we started up.  There was one other climbing pair we had talked to when they arrived at the lake that was planning on getting up about 5:30 and heading out.  They were just heading out when we were getting ready, but they had a pretty good head start still.  We followed their progress up the snow, as we debated which way we were going to go.  There were several good patches of snow to ascend, although the one snow finger looked a little sketchy so we were contemplating traversing right on the rocks to reach the next snow patch.</p>

			Ben led out and took turns kicking steps for us with Chris.  We felt the snow was soft enough with our mountaineering boots and ice axes that we left the crampons in the pack – yay training weight?  I think the pair in front of us wore crampons up.</p>

			As we approached the snow finger it looked a lot better and we stayed on that to continue gaining the snow up higher.  I was lagging behind (again) but was enjoying the awesome views we had that morning.</p>

			Finally the terrain leveled off a bit and I made up a little ground.  We traversed right and then headed up to the notch, skirting right around the rock band.  The group in front of us just started out when I reached the group to finish gearing up.  We changed into our shoes, packed away the boots and ice axes, and kiwi coiled the rope so we had about 24 meters between us.  Since I had already geared up at camp, I got the honor of leading off first.

			<p>
			From the notch we walked right to gain the ridge, and continued left on a little further before starting to simul climb.  Gear placements were few and far between. I was placing mostly cams, trying to keep a couple pieces between myself and Sara but that was proving challenging.  I was starting to run low on cams so I looked for a suitable anchor spot to bring Sara in and swap leads.  The terrain was fairly easy at that point so I built a pseudo anchor with a couple pieces and just used a sling to anchor in myself.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara following up the first section</span>

			<p>
			Our rack consisted of a #1 Master Cam, singles of #0.3 – 2 C4s, and a set of nuts with 10 double slings and 4 single slings.  I took the heavy pack from Sara (ice axes, mountaineering boots, crampons, food, water, and extras really added up fast) and swapped my remaining gear.  Sara and I kept in mind how heavy the follower pack was and both tried to be conservative on lead and really protect any moves we thought might be sketchy for the follower.  Things we normally would run out and not think twice about, we now considered differently when you add a heavy follower pack that limited our range of motion and sight.  Sara continued leading up the left side of the ridge on the blocky terrain, also trying to find gear placements.  I followed and by time she had built an anchor to bring me in, I was out of breath.  Following seemed like harder work that day for sure.  
			</p>
			<p>
			We swapped gear again and I tried to figure out where to go next.    We had gotten glimpses of Ben and Chris in front of us every so often to get a vague idea of where to head, but now they were out of sight.  There was a little down climbing section in front of me, but remembering that heavy followers pack, I decided to try and find something better.  Downclimbing another section looked even sketchier, so I started up.  I got to the top of the ridge with no good way to continue on – not quite time to gain the ridge.  I downclimbed back to Sara and finally decided on the first option.  The downclimbing was fine, just a bit awkward with the pack I figured.  I found some good holds, let Sara know, and continued traversing over.  After a bit, I headed back up to the ridge.  As I was going I heard some rock fall and quickly radioed down to Sara to make sure she was ok.  Apparently the bomber hand holds I had found on the downclimb weren’t quite so bomber and one broke off.  Sara was fine but such was the struggle of the entire climb – finding dependable rock.  I reached the ridge and continued along, finding a few vertical moves to continue.  Soon after pulling those moves, I slung a rock with a decent ledge for a belay and brought Sara up.</p>

			<p>
			Sara continued along the ridge, finding some nice airy step overs for me and some more vertical little steps.  There were many more horns along the ridge so more features were slung than gear placed.  The views were amazing and I loved looking west towards Mt Baker.</p>

			<p>
			I believe I had the crux of the climb, the 5.2-ish headwall. I started up, placed a few pieces and continued up.  I started up middle of the rock, followed a line to the left, and eventually to the right to top out on the section.</p>

			I asked Sara if she wanted a proper belay up it but she thought it looked fine and we continued simul climbing.  Not long after, I was starting to get low on slings and having found a nice huge ledge with some cracks to build a proper anchor in, I set up shop.  Sara soon popped over the head wall and walked along the ridge to me.</p>

			We finally had the summit in sight and waved to Ben and Chris who had already topped out.  I transferred the gear back to Sara as she led up the final section to the base of the summit.  As we neared the summit and she was running low on slings, we decided to keep walking without any protection – it was basically a flat walkway to the base of the summit.</p>

			We unroped, grabbed some food and the cameras, and did the last little scramble up to the summit. Finally got to check one of the two main climbs off of my list for the year, and bag my third top 100 Washington Peak, #17 at 8970'. After a quick snack and some summit treat nerds, we climbed up to the true summit to get some pictures.</p>

			The views were amazing, as they were throughout the whole weekend.  I love the North Cascades because of the amazing mountain vistas, it’s my favorite place to climb.</p>

			After getting entirely too many pictures, the group started down.  I was the last to leave the summit, trying to savor everything before heading down. Ben grabbed our rope and threw it in his pack, so I took Sara’s harness and slung it over my shoulder for the descent as she had the pack with the rest of our gear.  We descended the south route, one of the scramble routes up Black Peak.  The route was very loose which made the going a little slower.  Ben was out front navigating, trying to find the cairns as I brought up the rear.

			We finally reached the bottom of the ridge and continued on a little before we picked our way down to the snow.  There was a nice run out at the bottom of the first slope so we packed up the gear (I still had my harness with gear on) and grabbed our ice axes, gaiters, and gloves for the glissade down.  Sara let me take the pack/I stole it for the rest of the descent.  Chris was first down to the snow, wanting to plunge step down a little to distance himself from the rocks.  He slipped and just kept on glissading though.  Ben was next, followed by Sara, and I brought up the rear.  I was a bit loaded down and flew down the hill.  I kicked up so much snow that my face was plastered and I couldn’t see anything through my sunglasses.  We walked across the bowl to the next slope and got one more glissade down.  From there it was a short, maybe 5 minute walk back to camp.

			We broke down camp in about 30 minutes, treated some water, and started out.  I figured I’d be slow and would detest the ascent back up to Heather Pass.  We picked our way down the trails, keeping in sight of Ben and Chris.  We got a little turned around on some of the slabby rock, but after a minute decided to head out to the snow and continue down to Lewis Lake.  Instead of traversing around the lake on the trail like we had done on the way in, we stayed to the right side of the lake on the snow.  We continued along the snow and talus fields, finally reaching the trails again.  I was guessing I’d need to stop again for some more Gu, but tried to keep up a good pace.  Ben and Chris were out of sight as we ascended the last trails to Heather Pass.  After a quick water break, Sara took off down the trail with me in tow, back a little ways.  My knees were hurting a bit so I couldn’t quite keep up with Sara’s downhill pace.  Still, we were moving better than we expected and got back to the car at 6:30PM – to several friendly faces waiting for us in the parking lot.  Matt, Aaron, and Meredith had stopped on their way back from Washington Pass, hoping to time our arrival.  I think they waited about 40 mins before we arrived.  We all stopped in Marblemount for some burgers on the way home.  It was a gorgeous weekend with amazing mountain views and an awesome group to climb with.  Couldn’t have asked for a better start to my summer climbing season (finally)!
