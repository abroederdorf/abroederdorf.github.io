			<h1>Eagle Peak 12.30.12</h1>
			
			<p>			
			Aaron and I went to IL to spend Christmas, and decided to come back to Seattle for New Years Eve, hoping to get out and play in the mountains before we had to head back to work.  The weather forecast was looking good so we decided to head to the Tatoosh with Sara and Matt for a couple days of climbing, hopefully bagging six summits.  The plan was to do a ski tour of Denman, Plummer, Pinnacle, and Castle on Sunday, then head back up on snowshoes (at least for the girls) to tag Eagle and Chutla on Monday.  Sara found us a room at the bunkhouse just outside of the park to spend the night so we could enjoy a hot shower and warm bed rather than snow camping.  Wanting to limit the gear we were bringing, we decided on minimal rock gear.  We each brought a double sling and locking carabiner to fashion into a harness with a rack of off-width nuts, a few slings, and a half rope.  Checking the <a href="https://twitter.com/MountRainierNPS">Mount Rainier National Park</a> twitter feed, it looked like the gate at Longmire had opened at 8AM on Saturday.  Not expecting much snow overnight, we guessed the gate should open about the same time on Sunday so we aimed to be at Longmire by then.
			</p>
			<p>	
			We picked Matt and Sara up bright and early on Sunday and were on the road by 5:40AM.  We stopped in Puyallup to get breakfast at Starbucks and continued on.  As we neared the park, there was a little bit of snow on the road.  It looked like it had snowed some overnight so Aaron checked the twitter feed again, discovering they projected the gate to open at 10:30AM.  That was a later start than we were hoping for in trying to tag the four peaks.  We were fighting against the clock again in the limited daylight of winter.  I thought we should just switch our objectives and go after Eagle and Chutla.  Another option was just to try for two of the four peaks too.  We got to Longmire just a little after 8AM and found the sign on the gate predicting an 11AM opening.  People were starting to filter into the Longmire parking lot.  With the late start, we decided to switch to Eagle and Chutla.  Sara and I changed out of our ski wear since we'd be snowshoeing instead, and we got ready for our new objective.  As we were about ready, we heard they were opening the gate closer to 9AM.  Seeing as I'd already changed clothes once, I opted to stick with our new plan.
			</p>
			<p>	
			We were moving out of the parking lot a little before 9AM to head to the trail.  Aaron and Matt decided to ski while Sara and I opted for snowshoes.  It was a beautiful day and as we crossed the bridge, we had a great view of Mount Rainier in the morning sun.

			<p>	I soon discovered that I had forgotten my memory card at home - boo!  Luckily Matt was nice enough to lend me his since he figured he wouldn't be taking pictures.  As the guys got their skis on, I started out on the trail leading the group up.  We were first on the trail that morning so I got to break trail a little through the couple inches of new snow.  It wasn't much, other than I postholed a few times and had to clear a bunch of snow from the branches that hung down in the trail or else get snowed on repeatedly.  About 45 minutes in and 700 feet up, I stopped for a Gu break.  Sara decided it was time to put on our snowshoes, so we told the guys to head up and we'd follow.  We figured they could just take a lap on their skis with their extra time.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Sara started out breaking trail following the skin tracks.  I was trying out a new pair of gloves and while water proof, they didn't provide much insulation for my hands so my fingers were going numb.  That lead me to ball up my fingers to warm them which meant I couldn't hold my trekking poles, making my going a little slower and more sloppy.  I broke out my ShotBloks as I was feeling low on energy, but continued to lag behind Sara.  The trail was going through a winter wonderland, it was absolutely beautiful.

			<p>
			As we made our way up and it got later in the day, the sun started poking through the trees more.  I was a bit cold so we stopped in a good sun patch and Sara encouraged me to dig my mittens out of my pack to try and warm my hands so I could use my trekking poles.  It was a great idea and they soon started feeling better.
			</p>
			<p>
			We made it to the first open hill side finally, and I ate the last of my ShotBloks.  Being out in the sun was nice and I finally got blood flow back in all my fingers.  Just as we made our way to the bottom of the open slope, Matt came skiing down.  Aaron decided to take a break in the trees while Matt got a quick lap in.

				<figcaption class="caption">Matt skiing down the slope</figcaption>
			</center>
			<p>
			Sara started up, following some old tracks while I followed.  We had our first views of ridgelines and it was a gorgeous view of very snow covered trees in the sun.  As we made it to the top of that open slope, we got views of both Mt Adams and Mt St Helens in the distance - we really lucked out with the weather.

			</center>
			<p>
			Sara followed the skin tracks through the trees, but was still breaking quite a bit of trail.  Finally she let me take a turn breaking trail since I was feeling better and we soon found Matt and Aaron at the bottom of the slope leading to the saddle.

				<br>
				<figcaption class="caption">Sara breaking trail through the trees</figcaption>
			</center>
			<p>
			I grabbed another Gu to help prepare for the last bit of the climb up.  Aaron wasn't feeling very well and was having an issue with his brand new ski boots.  After talking a bit, we decided it best for him to head back down while we continued up to try and tag the summits.  Matt had already started up breaking trail, so he was going to get Eagle with us and then follow Aaron down.
			</p>
			<p>
			I started leading up the slope, following Matt's skin track which made a huge difference in breaking trail.  I had blazed my own trail to intersect his tracks and it was a wallow fest.  Sara and I made good time up to the saddle and were treated with a great view of Chutla and some of the other Tatoosh peaks like Lane, Pinnacle, and Plummer.

			<p>
			We took off our snowshoes while Matt took off his skis.  I kicked steps over on the traverse and wallowed my way up.  The snow was up past my knees and very soft.  I made it part way before Matt took over and broke trail the rest of the way.  We made it to the summit block and evaluated the situation.  There was about 10 - 15 feet of exposed rock with steep snow leading up to it and from it.  There looked to be some nice juggy holds, but we weren't sure about the snow.  I slowly fought my way up, clearing snow off the rock with my ice axe while Matt checked around the corner looking for a better route up.  We discussed our options for a while, and with Matt in ski boots, we decided Sara or I should try it if anyone would.  After picking out what we thought was the best option, I decided to give it a go.
			</p>
			<p>
			I put on my make believe harness of a double webbing sling, as I call it, and grabbed some gear from Sara.  There didn't look to be many good placements so I only grabbed a couple slings.  Sara tied the rope around a tree lower down as an anchor with a bowline, while Matt clove hitched into that rope and belayed me with a munter.  At least if I fell, I wouldn't fall all the way down the mountain.  I got one nut in on a questionable placement, and tried to figure out my best way up.  I moved left onto some high feet and made one more move above that.  I cleared snow off and saw lots of good jugs for my hands, but was not sure about the snow at the top of the rock.  I had to go farther left for the best option, but still wasn't sure about that.  It was sunny and the snow was already sloughing off.  It was an all or nothing to gain the snow and the summit, so I decided to back off and try again another day.  Matt decided to give it a go in his ski boots so Sara took his place belaying.

			</center>
			<p>
			Matt got a nut in in the same place I had one.  He checked left for a while, tried the snow to the right, and went back to the left.  He got to about the same place I was, and after more discussion, decided to back off as well.  
			</p>

				<br>
				<figcaption class="caption">Matt leading on the rock on the Eagle summit block in his ski boots and helmet</figcaption>
			</center>
			<p>
			Matt already had summited, and neither Sara or I needed to summit that badly.  We packed up and headed back to the saddle (and sunshine) to eat a little something before heading back to the car.  It was already 2PM so there wouldn't be time to try Chutla.  I'd have to come back for Eagle anyway so might as well leave both summits for another day.  Matt got his skis on and skiied down.  Sara fought her way down to make a glissade chute for me to follow in.  The snow was deep and sticky, making it challenging for the first one down glissading.
			</p>
			<p>
			We put our snowshoes back on after postholing, to make it to the second open slope back to the trail.  I tried taking turns making the gliassade chute without much success.  Sara eventually employed an interesting rolling/throwing herself down the hillside which made for a great track for me, and lots of laughter.  We put our snowshoes back on and started down the trail.  Matt stuck with us for a bit before Sara finally convinced him to head down in search of Aaron to check on how he was doing.  Sara started running down the mountain with me far behind in tow.  The snowshoes made the going a little slower and a bit more awkward.  We got back to the spot we had first put them on and Sara gladly took them back off to boot it the rest of the way back to the car.  We made it back to the road just after 4PM, right about sunset which made for a great last view of Mount Rainier.

			<p>
			The guys were walking down the road towards the trail at the same time so we all walked back to the car together.  Aaron was able to ski down part of the way before his foot hurt too much.  He still wasn't feeling good so we checked into our room at the bunkhouse and he slept while we grabbed dinner.  We decided to stay the night and head home in the morning.  No new Tatoosh summits for me, but a gorgeous day in the mountains.  That just means I'll have to talk people into heading down there with me again later in the spring to tag those objectives.
