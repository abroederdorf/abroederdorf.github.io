			<h1>Mount Defiance 1.1.14</h1>
			
            <p>
                The forecast for New Years day looked beautiful so we wanted to get out in the mountains.  The snow still wasn’t great so skiing was out.  We started throwing around possible climbing objectives and decided we wanted something closer to home so we could sleep in a little.  Finally we decided on Mount Defiance along I-90.  Neither Matt nor I had climbed it, and Sara was ok heading back since it had been a few years since she went up it.  Last March I had my mini epic on Bandera when I dropped a snowshoe and had to hike back up most of the trail to retrieve it from the nice couple who were carrying it down from near the top, where I had misplaced it.  Needless to say, I was pretty familiar with the beginning-to-middle portion of the trail.  We left Seattle about 7:30am and were able to drive all the way to the trailhead without encountering any snow.

                We hit the trail a little before 10am.  The trail was snow free until about 3200’, then we started encountering small patches of slick snow/ice in the early-ish morning.  I was cognizant of my hip flexor and took small steps to try and avoid making it sore.  We stopped about 1000’ of gain into the hike so I could stretch, conveniently at a nice bench along the trail.  As we started traversing back west across the slope, we encountered more snow.  As we left the trees and hiked along the boulders, lightly covered in snow, we stopped so I could apply some sunscreen.  We had officially hit the snow and it was slick.  With some of the REI gift cards I had gotten for Christmas, I picked up a pair of Micro Spikes.  I decided since I had brought them, I might as well try them out.  My shoe size was right in between sizes so I went with the small and it seemed to work out really well, very quick to throw them on my boots.  I was glad for the extra traction and it helped because I could take the sized steps I wanted instead of stepping for conditions, helping to save my hip flexor a little.

                We took the trail towards Mason Lake.  The whole slope was much more covered in snow when I was there last year, so I didn’t realize there was such a nice trail with signage.  We started dropping down from the ridge towards the lake and encountered more ice.  After carefully make their way down, Sara and Matt stopped to put crampons on.  All of us with some traction on our feet, we moved a lot faster. We stopped by the lake to take a couple of pictures, then continued following the trail through the trees.

                At some point we got a little off trail following a bootpack, but we eventually reconnected with the trail and continued up the ridge.  The snow was solid heading up through the trees, and interestingly granular out on the open slopes.  I think it had recently rained since all of the trees were starting to drop little ice chunks on us as the sun warmed them.  The icy snow was soft on the open slope as we made our way up, just below the summit.

                The clouds had been moving in and out throughout the morning but the views were spectacular as we reached the summit.  We met the first person all day just below the summit as she was heading down around 12:30pm.

                I was impressed by the views from the top of Mount Defiance.  The nearby Snoqualmie Pass mountains; more of the central cascades to the north with Glacier showing but Baker hidden in the clouds; mountains to  the distant east including Stuart; and of course Mount Rainier looming to the south with a distant Mount Adams.

                It was nice and sunny but I still grabbed my shell as I sat on my pack to eat some food.  After a little while another group of three appeared at the summit as well, the same three we had seen on the summit of Pratt Mountain last February.  I was starting to get cold so we headed back down a little after 1pm.

                We kept our traction footwear on, trying not to slide too much in the sun softened upper snow slopes.  The snow would ball up pretty badly under the micro spikes so Sara made some nice steps for me to follow in.  I’d stop and bang my feet against a tree or use my trekking pole to help knock the snow off every so often.  Back in the trees on the ridge the snow was firmer so I didn’t have that issue.  We followed the trail all the way down to the lake and started back up the ridge.  We met several groups here, mostly without any sort of traction devices.  Once back on the ridge we started down the trail.  We kept the micro spikes/crampons on until we hit the first patch of dirt and then packed them away.

            <p>
                My hip flexor was a bit sore so I was hiking down fairly slowly.  We crossed the last of the snow patches and hit dirt for the rest of the way.  We stopped and took a break on the bench on the way down.  I sat for a little while and I think it really helped.  I was still slow-ish going down but my hip flexor was a little less sore.  We made it back to the parking lot about 3:30pm.  We changed into our happy clothes and headed for Seattle to find some dinner.  It was a great first day of 2014 in the sunny, somewhat snowy mountains.
