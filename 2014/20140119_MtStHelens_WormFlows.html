			<h1>Mount St Helens - Worm Flows 1.19.14</h1>

			<p>
			The one volcano that I didn't attempt during the year of the volcano was Mount St Helens.  I think we assumed it would be an easy jaunt up and we were waiting for an open weekend with good weather.  We just never seemed to plan it, and after failing on other volcanoes, it didn't seem as urgent to tick that one off of the list too.  President's weekend this year was shaping up to look pretty good down there though, so we decided to give it a go. Aaron, Sara, Matt, and myself decided to head down.  We left Seattle Saturday afternoon, stopped for some ice cream at Dairy Queen, and registered ourselves at the Lone Fir resort before arriving at the Marblemount Sno-Park parking lot.  The road and parking lot were snow free.  There were a few other cars in the parking lot, including a large group, so we drove down towards the other end and found a nice campspot just next to the parking lot in the trees.  There was a small snowbank to walk over at the edge of the parking lot, otherwise we didn't have much to deal with.  We set up the four person tent, played a few games of cribbage, and went to sleep.  We planned to wake up and get going about 6am to maximize the amount of daylight we'd have.

			With the low snow year, we left the skis at home and brought snowshoes.  We easily found the Swift trail and started up it, hitting patches of snow here and there.   We turned off our headlamps in the early dawn hours, just before we got out of the trees.  The snow was a bit sloppy down low without a great boot pack to follow.  Once out of the trees, we finally got our first good look at Mount St Helens since we had arrived after dark the night before.

			The sky had clouds but the sun was just starting to rise over the horizon.  We weren't expecting a blue sky day but hopefully a little bit of sun would find us.  We continued up, finally starting to encounter the first parties along the way who had camped the night before.  We followed the signs and large cairns as we found our way across the creek and starting up the ridge.

			The snow wasn't superb.  Each of us had our fair share of post holing although it was taking a toll on Aaron.  He seemed to find the worst ones and kept tweaking his knee.  I wasn't feeling 100%, but when do I ever feel great when I'm climbing?  In an attempt to find better ground to keep from postholing we went up on some rocks and started to scramble along those for a bit -  something we've done a million times.

			Unfortunately this time I didn't look up before taking a rather large step up onto some rocks and missed seeing the rock jutting out above me.  I smacked my head hard into it, and sat in place as I tried to deal with the pain.  Everyone waited for a little as I tried to collect myself.  Sara ran through the standard questions to make sure I knew who I was, where I was, what day it was, and what had happened.  I had hit my head pretty hard and felt a little dazed, but I wanted to keep going to see if I could walk it off.  We continued up another couple hundred of feet. I just followed the group but as I went, I thought about what conditions might be like up higher, we were only about half way up.  I was a little concerned with my slight daze and how I might react in an icy situation with sharp pointy things attached to me, and decided the safer decision was to head down. Aaron was more than happy to head down with me, and as much as I tried to convince them to keep going and summit, Sara and Matt turned around with us as well.  For some reason I hadn't taken any pain killers for the throbbing head so after heading down for a little while, we stopped so I could grab some.

			As we were going down we started meeting more and more people on their way up, mostly with skis or splitboards strapped to their feet, while some groups had them strapped to their packs.  I didn't think conditions were very good for skiing but apparently they were going to make it work.  We decided to stop for some lunch after we crossed the stream again.  Several groups passed us as we sat in the snow.  We dropped back into the trees and followed the Swift trail out to the parking lot.  6 hours after starting we had made it half way up the mountain and back down.  Apparently I need to start wearing a helmet BCC style? (i.e. all of the time).  Thanks to my climbing partners for being understanding - my own clumsiness ruined a weekend a trip.  I think I'm on the hook to head back and ski it with them for our next attempt though, luckily that probably won't happen until the fall or next year.  It just wouldn't be right if I climbed a volcano on my first attempt anyways, right?
