			<h1>Vantage 3.16.14</h1>
			
            <p>
                The forecast looked decent in Vantage for a weekend of cragging.  Despite Aaron having spent the past weekend there and it being his least favorite place to climb in Washington, we planned to head back for another weekend.  Unfortunately I had to work Saturday so Aaron went out with a group on Saturday to climb, and I drove out after I was done with work that night to camp and then climb the next day.  The camping area was packed but I found them back in the corner.  It was still pretty cold in the morning so we woke up a little later, enjoyed some delicious breakfast burritos courtesy of Robert, and then headed to the Feathers.  Aaron had already led some good routes over his three days on the rock, so he let me head to the Feathers for some easy leads to ease into the season.  This year is the year of the road trip, we're taking three weeks to go rock climbing down in California, so we're trying to prepare. Part of my preparation involves getting started correctly and getting my lead head, which meant I wanted to start easier.

                Robert's friend Ted was top roping for the first time outside so we took him with us after he got abused at Sunshine Wall on Saturday.  The Feathers were packed, partially with a climbing club and partially because it was the nicest place in Washington that weekend to climb and everyone was itching to get out on the rock.  That basically meant we took what we could find.  I started off easier than I was even looking for on Mandatory Suicide (5.4), a nice corner stemming route.  Ted ran up it and seemed relieved to be climbing some shorter routes.  Aaron was the cleaning champion of the day - thanks!  Next I had my eye on the Notch Route (5.6) but a couple beat me to it so I took the nearby open route Updrafts to Heaven (5.5), always a fun chimney route.  Aaron quickly followed and then we hoped on the Notch Route (5.6) behind the couple.

                In keeping with my incremental increase in rating I was eyeing Altar of Sacrifice (5.7) but the climbing club there had a rope set up on it so we followed the couple to Jesus Saves (5.8), a fun route up the arete.  I remember it taking me a minute to figure out some of the moves the first time I led it a couple of years ago, and this time was no different.  I made my way up though and the two guys followed.  The club was just pulling their rope down on Altar of Sacrifice (5.7) so I jumped on that next.  It was one of the first routes I ever led, and this was my third time doing it.  It definitely feels like it's getting easier every time, so that's good.  I enjoy pulling over the small bulge with the bomber hand holds.  We had spent the morning in the shade on the north side of the Feathers so we headed back to camp in the sun after a good morning and grabbed some lunch.

                After lunch we decided to walk over to Sunshine Wall and find some of the group.  We found them at King Pins.  Peaceful Warrior (5.6) was open so I led that again.  A little longer route than the morning ones.  The crew had a rope up on George and Martha (5.10a) so Aaron and I both took a lap on that quick too.  It was definitely challenging for me and I fell out of the crack/took a break several times on the way up.  Several people were heading out so we decided to join them and head home.  We had some business to take care of anyways and were anxious to get back.  Overall it was a great first day outside on the rock, hopefully just the start I needed for the season!
