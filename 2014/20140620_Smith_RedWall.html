			<h1>Smith - Red Wall 6.20.14</h1>
			
			<p>
			We got to Smith Thursday night and set up camp.  The parking lot was fairly full but there were still a few spaces.  After showers, we retired to the tent to escape the wind and plan for Friday.  With how many people were around, we figured the rock would be pretty busy.  We decided to set the alarm for 6am and climb until the early afternoon.  Assuming it'd be slammed over the weekend, we figured one short day of climbing would be good before heading up to Leavenworth.  There were a couple of easy multi-pitches that were on my list, Super Slab (5.6) and Moscow (5.6).  Aaron also mentioned White Satin (5.9) and Skyridge (5.8) which sounded intriguing to me, as well as an assortment of single pitch routes we wouldn't mind getting on.  We decided to head for one of the easier multi-pitch routes first thing in the morning and go from there based on availability.

			We woke up about 6:30a, got camp packed up, ate breakfast, and drove down the road to the parking lot.  The climber's bivy was packed with cars so we expected a crowded day on the rock.  We took two ropes and Aaron's rack, hitting the trail down about 7:40a.  We took the Misery Ridge Trail and found an open Super Slab with no other climbers in sight.

			Since Aaron had climbed it before, he volunteered to take the second pitch so I could lead the first and third.  I geared up and started up.  The climbing was fairly easy and I followed the crack up to a nice, sandy ledge with bolted anchors.  I brought Aaron up and he took the gear from me.  The second pitch is a short traverse with minimal protection.  He placed once piece after starting, and managed to wiggle in a #0.4 in a little crack about half way across, just before the crux of walking around the little bulge.  He built a gear anchor, making sure to leave me the big gear, and brought me across.

			I really liked the third pitch, the crack climbing was a lot of fun.  Aaron thought it was long so I ran out my placements a little bit to make sure I'd make it.  As I neared the top, I saw the wide crack on the right of the detached block.  As much as I wanted to go around left, I figured I'd head up the wide bit.  I placed a #3 near the base of it, pulled up past the constriction (with a piece of old webbing jammed in there), and then placed the #4.  I probably didn't need to place the #4 as a couple more moves brought me to the top with bolts for an anchor.

			There were three bolts, one seemed a lot more secure than the other two so I used all three for my anchor and brought Aaron up.  There were lots of hikers at the park and many were stopping to watch, take pictures, and wave at us.  Aaron took the second rope we had backpacked up in the rope bag and found a set of chains climbers right at the top.  I broke down the anchor and brought over the other rope.  We had done numerous double rope rappels in Yosemite but I had never actually tied the European Death Knot so I asked Aaron if I could while he flaked the rope.  I rappelled first, back to the sandy ledge near the top of the first pitch, and found a second set of chains.  One more rappel down (didn't need the full 60m) brought us to the ground, 1.5 hours after starting.

			Since we had already hiked over to Red Wall I asked if we could check out Moscow next.  It was also open so we got on that.  Again, Aaron had climbed this route in the past so he took the second pitch so that I could lead the first and third.  I grabbed the gear and started up the broken corner.  It was a lot steeper than Super Slab, although rated the same at a 5.6.  I placed a piece, pulled a couple moves up and found a placement for a nut.  As I struggled through this section a bit more than I would have liked, there were several people standing nearby watching me - I think the audience made me more nervous.  I got past the initial blocky part, staying on the 5.6 crack and bypassing the 5.7 option.  I knew I was suppose to head left to better rock but the left I tried taking I didn't like very much.  I downblimbed a little and kept going up towards the crack on the second pitch.  I felt off route but there were some chalk marks.  The climbing wasn't impossible but I'm guessing a little more difficult than if I had gone left.  I found a little alcove and built a gear anchor to bring Aaron up, at the base of the corner crack for pitch 2.

			He took the gear back and after a few steep moves from the belay ledge, headed up the corner crack.  The climbing definitely felt more steep than Super Slab.  He found a little ledge and built a gear anchor, again saving the big gear for me.  I headed up the corner, reaching the fourth class terrain above.  I continued up a little bit, until finding some nice, large boulders to sling for my anchor.

			I brought Aaron up and we had one more trickier fourth class scramble to top out, but it wasn't too bad.  We found the trail, put our shoes on, and hiked back down to our packs, arriving 2 hours after we had started climbing.  I was happy that both routes seemed to take nuts so well for gear placements.  I think I liked Super Slab better, but it was fun to get to climb the last two moderate multi-pitch routes at Smith that were on my list.  We packed up and grabbed a snack.  As we hiked back to the car another group was getting on Moscow, and there were several on/waiting for Super Slab.  I guess we timed it just right!  We left the park by 1:15p, headed north to our next climbing destination.  It was a fun, short day at Smith to tick a couple popular climbs off my list.
