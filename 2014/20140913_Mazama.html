			<h1>Mazama 9.13.14</h1>
			
			<p>
			Sara's cousin Melissa was in town for another climbing adventure and wanted to get on some rock, so we decided WA Pass would be a good area to go.  Melissa got in Friday night so we decided to drive out Saturday morning.  Not wanting to leave ridiculously early from Seattle, we decided to take it easy on Saturday and head to Mazama to get a little cragging in and expose Melissa to some roped climbing.  We stopped at Lone Fir on the way through to grab a campsite and then were on our way to the crag.  We hiked up to Sun Rock, very warm on the mid-September day but it was a gorgeous weather weekend.  Sara started by leading Gobbledygook (5.6).  We went over tying the rewoven figure-8 and Melissa got to try out the rock shoes.  She made quick work of the route and got a lesson in cleaning quick draws, which she did throughout the afternoon.  Melissa got more practice belaying as I went up last to clean the anchor.

			I saw that there was a decent ledge on the next route to the left, which I thought might be good for a mock multi-pitch pitch so Melissa could experience the belay from above, anchoring in, and rappelling.  Sara wanted to let her get one more climb in before we turned the fire hose of information on full blast, so I led Cognitive Dissonance (5.7).  A few more thin sections, but another good little sport climb.  Melissa followed second, cleaning the draws, and Sara went up last to clean the anchor.  Another group showed up at the crag to get some lead practice in so Sara led up Smoove B (5.7-) and brought Melissa up next to do the mock mini multi-pitch.

			After they both rappelled down, I led Prometheus the Giggolo (5.8), the left most route at the wall.  An interesting little route that heads up along the corner.  After everyone had finished climbing that route, we moved back up the trail just a little bit to climb Bambino Buttress (5.6).  It's a weird route with big blocks and ledges and lots of bolts, much easier than anything we had climbed.  We contemplated trying the 5.10a but weren't sure which anchors to drop the rope on so instead we called it a day and went into Winthrop to get some dinner.  A good afternoon of cragging, getting some time on the rock so we were all ready for our alpine adventure at WA Pass on Sunday.
