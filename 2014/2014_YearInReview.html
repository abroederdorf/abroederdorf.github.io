			<h1>2014 Year in Review (Stats)</h1>
			
			<p>
			The big objective for 2014 was the rock climbing road trip Aaron and I planned for June.  With that in mind, I definitely had a rock climbing centric year which was nice after having to sit on the sidelines most of 2013 due to my shoulder.  As a result of that focus though, I didn’t get out in the mountains for hikes very often, and a nagging hip flexor injury cut down on the running as well.  We also had a few life distractions come up that put some of our fun activities on the backburner, like buying our first house.

			We did get a lot of skiing in early in the year luckily, since by the end of the year there was barely sufficient snow coverage for the resorts to open.  We made it up to Mount Baker for a long weekend of skiing with one of my college roommates which was fun – we lucked out with some awesome snow that weekend.  Aaron and I also met some of his family it Utah for a weekend of skiing, my first time skiing there.  We met Alicia at Park City our first day, then headed north to Snowbasin the second day.  Snowbasin was great!  We had sunny skies and great groomers, it felt like spring skiing.  That was probably my favorite day of skiing the whole year.  We squeezed in one last day of the year at Crystal, my first time there, and I found a few runs I really enjoyed.

			With the road trip planned, we wanted to be in good climbing shape to make the best of it.  I started climbing more, but with a keen awareness of my shoulder as it still gets sore.  I tried to ease into more routes and increasing difficulty, while keeping a check on overhung routes.  Aaron had wanted to join the elite training class at the gym but I didn’t think my shoulder was ready for that, so we climbed ourselves as much as possible.    As we neared the start of the outdoor season, we got a little leading in to get ready too.

			At the beginning of March we decided to start looking for a house, and over the next month we didn’t get out much because of it.  We were able to sign e-papers during a Vantage trip, but for the most part we stuck closer to Seattle.  We found a place in mid April and after that got back outside, spending Easter in Leavenworth and heading out the following weekend as well.   We had another great long weekend in Leavenworth at the beginning of May for the BOEALPS campout, but then spent the rest of the month starting to get ready for our move and the road trip. We managed one last ‘local’ climbing trip to Squamish during the ICC outing at the end of May.  It was a lot of fun and I got a lot of good climbing in, both leading and following. On June 7th we hit the road on our way to California.  
			</p>
			<p>
			After swinging through the Redwoods National Park, we drove to Yosemite for our first week.  We quickly realized on our first morning there that it was entirely too hot for us to climb (100+ deg heat) so we decided to leave our camping reservations early in the Valley and head up to the recently opened, and more importantly much cooler, Tuolumne Meadows.  We did enjoy some of the sights in the Valley before leaving and got a few fun climbs in, but Tuolumne was definitely my favorite part of the trip.  We eased in to see how I’d handle the altitude (8600’), and progressed from there.  First day single pitch, second day multi-pitch, and after a very windy rest day, our stay in the meadows culminated with an alpine climb of Cathedral Peak topping out just shy of 11,000’.  The climbing was a lot of fun on the knobby granite and the temperatures were more our style, we were so glad we went there instead of staying in the Valley.
			</p>
			<p>
			We bid farewell to Yosemite and headed north to Lover’s Leap near Tahoe.  Unfortunately the tree pollen was really bad so allergies kept us moving along, cutting a week from our trip that would have been spent climbing there.  Instead we enjoyed exploring the lava tubes at Lava Beds National Monument, admired the amazingly blue water of Crater Lake, ticked a couple classic easy multi-pitches off of my list at Smith (Moscow and Super Slab), and made it to Leavenworth to help with the first outing of BRC.  Overall it was a great trip, I really enjoyed climbing, seeing sights, and camping for the two weeks.  The road trip also gave me a great excuse to buy a new car which is much more mountain appropriate than my previous car.

			July we took a bit of a break from climbing, focusing instead on settling into the new house and getting a couple of hikes in.  I started playing softball again and unfortunately hurt my hip flexor pretty badly.  I took some time off from everything and after some rest and a family visit, we headed up to Squamish.  We had a really fun weekend of climbing, helping with BRC the first day and climbing Skywalker on our own on Sunday, culminating in our engagement at the pools of Shannon Falls.  I tried softball again only to reinjure the not-quite-healed hip flexor so I took some more time off so we could help out with the BRC graduation climbs at WA Pass.  We went but I had a mostly unsuccessful weekend due to feeling ill.  I sort of made up for it the following weekend when we did the through hike of the Enchantments, with a quick side trip up Enchantment Peaks.  It was a long day and I’m OK not seeing the Snow Lake trail for quite some time, but it’s always a good time when in the Enchantments. Sara and I agreed she got to complain on the way up to Aasgard Pass, and I got to complain as soon as we started heading down from Lake Viviane – I think I took advantage of that agreement more than she did.

			In September we got back in our groove and got out every weekend, either rock climbing or hiking.  I climbed for the first time outside of BCC at Mount Erie when Alicia was in town.  It was interesting, not my favorite, but somewhere I should probably try more often.  Sara’s cousin Melissa came out for some climbing again so we headed back up towards WA Pass for a weekend adventure and I had a lot more fun that time, climbing at Mazama and heading up SEWS.  October was a busy month for us with things that kept us out of the mountains, which nicely coincided with the start of our normal off season.  In November we had a couple of rare, sunshine filled weekends so we headed out for a couple of late season hikes.  We’ve been anxiously awaiting the snow to really fly in the mountains so we’ve just started skiing, but we did get one last hike in during December too.  Hopefully we’ll get out more on our skis soon!

			With our climbing focus and my hip flexor issues, I mostly stayed away from the running shoes.  I didn’t do any races and I only started running again in Oct, to be sidelined with a bad, long lasting cold in December.  Maybe next year I’ll get out for a few more runs but I don’t think it’ll be a main focus again.  Looking ahead to 2015 I’m not expecting to be out in the mountains nearly as much as I’m starting school again.  Hopefully everyone else is right and I’ll still find time to climb, but we’ll see what 2015 brings.
