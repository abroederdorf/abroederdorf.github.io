			<h1>South Early Winters Spire - South Arete 9.14.14</h1>
			
			<p>
			We estimated taking 9 hours car-to-car to climb the South Arete on South Early Winters Spire (SEWS), 5 hours for the approach/descent and 4 hours on rock climbing and descending.  We planned to wake up at 7a to hit the trail about 8:30a.  It was much colder than I was anticipating overnight, making it almost impossible for me to get out of my warm sleeping bag in the morning - so we took a little extra time to get going.  We packed up camp, packed our backpacks with only the climbing items we need, filled up water, and drove the less than 10 minutes to the Blue Lake Trailhead.  We brought 6 double alpine draws, 8 single alpine draws, nuts #4 - 10, and C4 cams #0.3 - 2, with doubles of #0.5 - 1.  Not the lightest rack but a bit lighter than our normal while still trying to bring lots of slings and enough gear to have a couple of long simul-climbing sections.  We brought one 60m rope for our team of three.  There were several other groups in the parking lot, including some familiar faces.  We heard there were going to be a lot of groups on the SW Rib of SEWS so I was hoping we'd be at the top before all of those groups starting descending, since the descent route is the South Arete which we wanted to be climbing up.

			We made decent time on the trail until we hit the meadow, then the up part really kicked in and I really slowed down.  We made our way along the trail, finding a right fork somewhere that took us out on the slabs.  Sara navigated us back to the highway of a trail and we continued up to the base of the South Arete.  We had encountered a couple of goats already, found another one not far from the trail, and saw several up on the ridgeline.  Melissa quickly picked up our rock throwing technique to keep them at a distance from us.  We ascended the loose rock to the ridge and started getting ready for the climb.  There was one group starting up the second pitch when we arrived, but they were long gone by time we started.  After some sunscreen and food, we put our needed food and water in Melissa's pack to act as the follower's pack, and put everything else in the remaining two backpacks to be hung in a tree out of the reach of the goats.  There was a lot of rock throwing at the beginning of this to get the large group of goats to move away from the start of the route.  We decided to pitch out the first two pitches with the leader in the middle of the rope, then we'd simul-climb the rest.

			<p>
			I got the lucky job of leading the first two pitches so I grabbed our seemingly small rack and all of the slings and started up.  I placed a good amount of gear at the start when there were some cracks, but that soon gave way to blocky terrain that I mostly ran out up to the new (new to me at least) bolted chains.  I clipped in an anchor in a box, got the two on auto-belay with my guide ATC, and started belaying them up.  Melissa insisted on carrying the follower's pack the entire climb and she did great with it.  She climbed next while Sara followed behind cleaning the gear.  </p>
			</p>		
			<p>
			Once they got anchored in I grabbed the gear back from Sara and we re-flaked the rat's nest I had created with the ropes.  Then I was off on the second pitch, trying to stay ahead of the couple of guys behind us.  There's not a lot of gear placements low in the gully before the chimney so I had only put in a couple pieces when Sara told me I had about 10 feet of rope left - I wasn't going to be able to climb the chimney and make it to the anchor just above.  Melissa and Sara unclipped from the anchor and simul-climbed with me just enough so that I could climb the chimney and anchor in at the rap station there.  I brought them up and had Sara throw a sling around the big dead tree up just a little higher so we could move to another ledge and get out of the way of the guys behind us.  Melissa and I switched places on the rope so that she would be in the middle and I could be last to clean gear.  Sara and I made some baby kiwi coils, she grabbed the gear, and was off.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I belayed Sara until it got to Melissa, then I stuck her on belay until it was time for me to simul-climb.  Of course as I'm belaying, the guys behind us pass and the group that had been climbing the South Arete was now descending - a bit of a cluster.  The guys descending did a great job to make sure not to tangle with us and the other guys seemed to take another route up.  We moved fairly well simul-climbing, from my perspective in the back at least.  Just before the last steeper section leading to the shark fin we could all see each other and talk, which was fun.

			Sara finished plugging a couple of pieces in that final section and hauled us up just before the shark fin.  I gave her back all of the gear, double checked she knew where the route went next, and off she went across the shark fin.  She clipped the lone bolt on the backside, then continued up the blocky terrain occasionally placing some gear.

			In no time we were at the summit!  After some snacks, we bouldered up onto the summit block and took in the amazing views, it was the perfect weekend to be out in the mountains.  We got our downclimbing warmup down off of the summit block and decided to stay unroped downclimbing until we got to the rappels.

			We made good time down, figuring out the steeper downclimbing sections (mostly just reaching the foot holds) and found the first rappel station just before the first group on the SW Rib started descending behind us.  I set up the rappel and went down first to help move the rope along the awkward, blocky terrain.  Melissa navigated the awkward rappel well and soon we were throwing the rope down the chimney and gully for our second rappel.  I'm a really good tosser and lassoed a tree, which I got to untangle on my way down.  We knew the rope wouldn't reach all the way to the anchor but it did get us down to a nice ledge just a few steps away from the anchor.  Finally we set up our last rappel from the chains, the best rappel since the terrain is the most vertical.  Our packs still looked to be intact in the tree, but after I reached the bottom I noticed a goat and her kid in the shade of the tree, just below our packs. I employed some more rock tossing in their general direction to get them to move farther along the ridgeline, and we got our packs, excited to get out of our rock shoes and eat a little more food.

			The initial descent from the ridge was just as terrible as going up on the loose stuff, but before too long we hit the climbers' trail highway again.  We had several more goat encounters on the way down so we hiked with rocks in our hands most of the way.  We followed the climbers trail down and met up with the Blue Lake trail again.  I was happy to be on the last leg out and we made good time back on the better trail.  We made it to the parking lot about 6pm, roughly 9 hours after we started.  We changed into some clean clothes and hit the road in search of food, eventually settling on Mondo in Marblemount where we got a variety of different cuisines.  After seeing some more familiar faces walk in and chatting about everyone’s climbing over the weekend, we drove back to Seattle so that Sara could get Melissa to the airport for her flight home.  Amazing weather and fun climbing, another great weekend in the mountains!
