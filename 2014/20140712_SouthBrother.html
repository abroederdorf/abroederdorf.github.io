			<h1>The South Brother 7.12.14</h1>
			
			<p>
			The weather forecast had a low chance for rain in the areas we were hoping to climb, however technical climbing and wet rock don't mix, at least for me.  We found some sunshine in the Olympics over The Brothers though, so after some planning, we decided to climb the South Brother in a day on Saturday.  We packed up Friday after work and left Seattle about 7:30p.  All of the campgrounds near the Lena Lake trailhead were full so we continued on the road and found a pullout near the river where a bunch of other people had already set up camp.  I parked and we set the tent up next to the car in the dark.  We were in sleeping bags by 10:45p, with the alarm set for 4a.  Despite the soft rock dance party going on nearby, I think we all managed to get a few hours of precious sleep before the long, hot day.
			</p>
			<p>
			We packed up the tent, drove to the trailhead, ate some breakfast, and hit the trail at 5a.  We weren't sure when we'd hit snow exactly, but we brought ice axes and boots.  Sara and I both decided to carry our boots though while Aaron wore his backpacking boots the whole day.  Sara wore her approach shoes while I did the hike in in my running shoes.  It was just light enough that we didn't need our headlamps as we started following the trail up to the lake. Aaron carried a water filter so that we could tank up on water at the climber's bivy.  We made it to the lake about 6:30a and found it full of campers.  We stopped for a little break and I tried to talk my way into getting left at the lake to nap all day - I was really tired.  We continued around the lake, following the trail into the Valley of the Silent Men.  It was nice hiking through the trees all morning, and we hadn't met anyone on the trail yet.  We crossed 6 bridges before finally arriving at the climber's bivy.  It was just after 8a but we were hungry so we all broke into food.  Aaron and Sara filtered water while I tried to nap on my knees.

			We continued on, picking up the trail, and starting to follow ribbon through the trees.  We bounced back and forth between following a dry creek bed up and bushwhacking through the tall ferns and bushes.  As we emerged from the trees we were surprised to find a lot of rock gullies - where'd the snow go?  It didn't look like we'd be encountering snow any time soon, but not knowing what the upper part of the mountain looked like, we continued carrying the ice axes and boots.  We stopped once out of the trees to put sunscreen on.  The sun was blazing - it'd be a hot, long hike to the top.  We continued up the trail, losing it a bit through the burnt section.  We veered too far climber's right, missing the trail along the left edge.  Aaron spotted some ribbon so we got back on the trail and headed into the rock gully up.  At the top of that there was a small, flat area before heading up the next large gully - also void of snow.

			We were finally high enough to get our first views, we could see Mount Rainier across Puget Sound.  After a quick break, we continued up the climber's left side of the gully, following the dirt trail.  There were wildflowers blooming like crazy, but soon we had passed through those and made it to the choss.  The classic loose rock, one step forward to slide two steps back, made the going slow.  We followed the trail up onto the ridge, climbed up some third class rock, and found the most amazing cairn ever.  We stopped for lunch on the ridge just before noon, and having a good look at most of the rest of the route, we left our ice axes behind at the cairn.  Figuring my mountaineering boots would be better for scrambling I changed into those.

			We started back up the choss, trying to follow the remnants of boot packs in between cairns.  We stayed on the ridge, eventually heading to the right side.  We found cairns but as we started heading up the exposed fourth class rock, we weren't sure if we were actually on route.  It was 1p, our initial turn around time, and not knowing if we were on route we decided to play it safe and head back before we got ourselves into something we wished we had a rope for.  We were about 900' shy still of the summit.  We started back down, picking our way slowly down the choss.  We made it back to the cairn, picked up our gear, and continued the slow, controlled fall-descent of the choss.  We were slowly running out of water, anxious to get back to the clibmer's bivy and filter cold, stream water.  We made steady progress down, staying on the correct trail through the burnt section this time and following more ribbons through the brush outside of the trees.  Once back in the trees the trail seemed way longer to get back to the bivy.

			We arrived and quickly grabbed the filter, gulping down the first liter between the three of us.  There was a group there with a ranger, we think to help with goat management (they had paintball guns).  After we had our fill of cold water with plenty more for the last 6 miles out, we hit the trail again.  We hadn't met anyone else until we made it back to the climber's bivy but we met a few more groups on the way down to Lena Lake.  We passed on the no snow conditions to another pair heading up, so hopefully they could leave their crampons and ice axes at camp.  We finally made it back to the lake with just the three mile home stretch.  There were lots of day hikers on this last section as my body started hating me more and more for the 16+ miles and 5000'+ I had put it through already.  We made it back to the car after 7p, happy to be done and to sit down.  We changed, packed up the car, and headed for home.  We stopped for some DQ for dinner and made it back to Seattle around 11p.  A long, hot day in the mountains without a summit but it was still good to get out and push myself.
