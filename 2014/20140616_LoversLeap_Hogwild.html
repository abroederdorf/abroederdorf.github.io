			<h1>Lover's Leap - Hogwild 6.16.14</h1>
			
			<p>
			The trail up to Hogwild was just a few feet from our campsite so about 5 minutes of walking through the woods, near the river, brought us to the rock.  We were at Just Acquaintances (5.6). The other couple of routes Aaron had in mind at Hogwild were a 5.7 and a 5.8, so I decided to lead this one.  I grabbed the gear and started up the crack.  The rock at Lover's Leap is filled with horizontal dikes, which make great ledges for feet.  Thanks to our recent climbing on the knobs of Tuolumne meadows, I was sort of used to staying outside the crack so it wasn't too big of a deal standing on the dikes.  However, I felt less confident when the crack flared out and I had to use the dikes for my hands too.  The dike features definitely take a little getting used to.

			I climb under the mindset of place when you can, not when you have to.  With all of the good foot ledges, I sewed up the first part of the climb.  I started running it out towards the top and placed my last piece just before the top.  However, I decided to go right instead of left and traverse across the face a bit, meaning I had to climb higher to find a new tree for an anchor.  I had no slings left, a #0.75, and 6 nuts.  I grabbed the webbing off of my rescue biner and slung this sort of tree branch thing growing out of the wall, but it wasn't in a good spot for an anchor.  I continued up and found this rock handle-flake.  It was attached at the top and bottom to the rock wall, but detached in the middle, so I took a prusik cord and slung that.  I ran it out until I got to a huge tree on some sandy ledges and belayed Aaron up.

			Aaron was visibly tired when he reached me, he had no energy and his face seemed a little swollen - his allergies were getting the best of him.  We decided to walk down rather than battle a rappel on a flake filled route in high winds.  We had to walk down the back side and then around camp to the base to get our shoes and packs.  I left Aaron at our campsite and continued back to the base of the route to grab our gear.  The cars in the parking lot at the campground were covered in pollen, and after checking the weather forecast, the high tree pollen levels are expected to continue all week.  We decided to call the trip early and start heading home.  We walked around the campground after dinner in the waning light to check out some of the main walls.  There looked to be a lot of fun climbing in the are, both at Lover's Leap and other South Tahoe locations.  It'll take a little getting used to the dikes, but hopefully we can head back when there's a little less tree pollen flying around.
