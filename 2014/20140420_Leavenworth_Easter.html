			<h1>Leavenworth Easter Cragging 4.20.14</h1>
			
			<p>
			We had intended to get out to Leavenworth for some climbing in early April but there was a last minute change to plans, so finally in late April we got our second opportunity.  Sunday was looking decent down Icicle Creek so Aaron and I left about 7am Sunday morning and stopped for some Sultan Bakery breakfast on the way out.  Aaron suggested Castle Rock since he's only climbed there a little and I had never been, but I didn't think I was ready for old school 5.6 rated climbs quite yet, I wanted to plug some gear into the wall on something a little easier.  We decided to check on R&amp;D since Aaron wanted to lead Cocaine Crack (5.10a).  We arrived to find five groups on or waiting to get on the route, so we kept on driving.  We thought we might escape some of the crowds since it was Easter Sunday but apparently everyone had the same idea that we did.  We noticed that Barney's Rubble was open when we drove by so we circled back around.  I figured the 5.6 crack might be a good start for me.

			We parked and crossed the street to reach the crag.  I geared up and got on the 5.6 crack.  I got new TC Pros but I didn't want to break in new shoes while leading, so I donned my old 5-10s.  I have to admit I was a lot more nervous than I expected on route, but I plugged about 5 pieces in and was soon pulling around/over the flake.  I thought I could place a #2 cam under the flake before pulling around it and I remembered correctly.

			Aaron cleaned the route, then pulled the rope so he could lead the 5.8 crack to the left.  I remembered having a hard time getting into the crack the last time I climbed it and this time was no different.  The constriction was just a little too high for me to get my foot into, so I eventually lie backed it.  It wasn't pretty but I got in the crack and topped out.  I dropped the ropes and then walked around, just as a large group descended on Barney's Rubble.

			Knowing I'm a fan of the 5.7's at Clamshell Cave, we headed there next.  There were lots of cars parked along the road but we hoped they were bouldering.  Unfortunately there was a group of six taking over all of the climbs I was hoping to get on.  We ate some lunch as Aaron eyed the bolted face climb.  He scrambled up and dropped a top rope for us so we could get on something.  This was my first time climbing GRTC (5.10b).  Aaron climbed first and made it through the crux down low without too many issues.  I had a hard time trying to make my way across the face and up to the better holds.  After falling a bunch, with Aaron's encouragement, I gave it one last shot and decided to chimney up the side instead.  This let me bypass the crux and get out on the face to continue climbing up.  There was only one group up by Clamshell Crack and they looked to be on the other route so we headed up next.  I didn't know if I wanted to tackle Clamshell Crack (5.7) with the challenging start and exit after my rocky start to the day, so Aaron led it and I followed.

			The group finally left so we headed down to the other ledge next and I led Noisy Oyster (5.7).  I love starting that route by slinging a tree.  I felt much more relaxed and enjoyed climbing the crack, placing gear.  Getting out on the slab at the top, protected by bolts, is always interesting so I wore my old trusty shoes for that route. Aaron ran up the route quick and then we moved right to Shrimp Salad (5.6).  I decided to do my first lead in my new shoes.  I racked up and started off.  It's not as straight forward of a crack as Noisy Oyster (5.7), but I made my way up and was soon at the top, pulling one of my cams on the traverse to help with rope drag as I lowered off.  Aaron cleaned the route, we packed up, and headed down to the car.

			It was about 3pm so we drove back to R&amp;D to see if we could get on it.  We were disappointed to find another five teams on route.  We didn't want to wait that long to finish the climb so we kept driving.  Playground Point/Clamshell had a ton of cars parked on the road.  We passed XY Crag, Tree Route, and Classic Crack to find the same scenario.  We had gotten a few climbs in and felt pretty good so we decided to call it an early day and head into town for some Easter dinner sausage before heading home.  It was a great day in Leavenworth plugging gear in the cracks and climbing some rock.
