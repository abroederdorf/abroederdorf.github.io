			<h1>BOEALPS Fall Campout - Leavenworth: R&D (Cocaine Crack), The Boneyard, & Underhill 9.27 - 9.28.14</h1>
				
			<p>
			The days are shorter and the nights are cooler, and to help welcome fall it was the annual BOEALPS fall campout in Leavenworth.  We spent the weekend with our base camp at Bridge Creek and climbed along Icicle Creek.  Our plan was to head in and finally climb Outer Space (5.9) on Snow Creek Wall.  Anticipating a busy route, we decided to get going very early to be at the wall ready to climb at sunrise.  We left about 5:10am from the trailhead and I started out in front.  I left my jackets in my pack so I started hiking a bit quicker to warm up.  It was dark and I counted the switchbacks to give myself something to do (there are 24).  Once we had cleared the switchbacks, Sara asked for a quick break - in reality I needed the break.  I wasn't feeling great so I ate some food and drank a little water and let the others know I needed a longer break so they could put jackets on.  I still wasn't feeling good and eventually walked up the trail a bit and lost my breakfast - I tried to cover it with a leaf.  I was feeling better but was a little concerned about my energy level for the climb, now that most of what I had eaten that day was  no longer in my body.  We continued hiking and within a few minutes found the climbers' trail heading down, across the creek, and up to Snow Creek Wall.  Matt and Sara had crossed the creek already when we decided it might be best to wait for another day and head down.  We waved bye and started the hike down as the sun was coming up.  There was a crazy fog layer over Leavenworth that made it look like there was a lake above the town.  We met several groups on the way in, a few with climbing gear and reports later confirmed that it was indeed a busy day on the wall.

			We got back in the car and drove to R&amp;D.  Aaron wanted to lead Cocaine Crack (5.10a) so as a consolation prize for a couple hours of hiking and not doing Outer Space, we got on R&amp;D.  We sat in the car for a bit as I tried to eat some pretzel goldfish and shotbloks to replenish some of the energy I had lost.  There was surprisingly no one on the wall yet at 8:30a as we started to get ready.  A few cars showed up as we were just about to hike to the start.  I've only ever led the second pitch and the last pitch(es), through the triple crack to the top.  As he was flaking out the rope, Aaron decided I should take the first pitch.  I took the the proper route straight up the blocky terrain and angled towards Cocaine Crack.  I found a few cracks and built an anchor from nuts mostly with a #2 too.  Aaron said he needed small cams for Cocaine Crack so I tried to leave those.  Aaron quickly followed up and grabbed the gear from me, then started up.  The nice thing is that I could see and talk to him the whole time.  He made it up the first part with no issues, then took his time through the traversing section until he could get to the piton under the roof.  He continued out left from the roof and up some 5.9 blocky moves to the large ledge, where he slung a boulder for an anchor.

			Good thing he had a bomber anchor as I needed the help.  The first part of Cocaine Crack is like climbing up a flake, it was a lot of fun.  Then came the traverse part which was very challenging.  I kept slipping on my feet and sliding right, so I gratefully used the cams Aaron had placed to help keep myself in the crack.  I removed the gear from the crack but left it on the rope as I couldn't expend any extra energy to rack it on my harness.  I made it to the roof, got out to the 5.9 blocky stuff, and used a thigh hook to get myself up.  I have lots of great bruises thanks to that move.  I was very tired when I got to the anchor and was glad the team behind us was just finishing their first pitch so that I could take a break before leading the triple cracks.  The boulder Aaron used was a bit low so I knew I wouldn't be able to top out on a single rope length.  We decided to split the last chunk into two pitches just to make it easier.  After struggling more than I remember to get on the ramp below the triple cracks (more beaching was involved), I moved up the triple cracks and went climber's left at the top to sling the tree root and bring Aaron up.  I really wanted to keep climbing instead of building an anchor, so Aaron handed back the gear and let me finish the lead.  I slung the big boulder on top and Aaron followed up behind me.  After a quick break to put on our approach shoes and take a few pictures, we started the descent.  The descent of course starts with a bit more up to get farther back on the crag before taking the trail down.  I could tell I was warn out - probably from our morning hike, the little bit of food I had, and the climb we had just done.  I slowly followed behind and finally we were heading down. The rest of the day there seemed to be a steady flow of teams heading up R&amp;D so we really lucked out with our timing.

			Not having made a plan with Sara and Matt before parting ways, I wanted to make sure we didn't leave them stranded.  Aaron and I guessed at a timeline and figured they might be down about 2:30p, so with the few hours we had we went back to camp to eat some lunch, and instead of climbing somewhere for just a couple hours, decided to go on a driving adventure.  Neither of us had been down Icicle Creek past the Johnny Creek campgrounds so we decided to see where the road led.  We made it past the pavement and onto the gravel to discover several more campgrounds, many trailheads, and a guardshack.  We followed the road and went as far as we could.  By the distance on the sign we had made it to the end, but there was still road continuing on - it was just too overgrown to follow in the car.  Our driving adventure took over an hour and a half, who knew you could drive on Icicle Creek for so long?  It wasn't quite 2:30 yet so we drove into town to get a milkshake.  It sounded good to me so Aaron was all about getting me some food to eat.  We hiked up the trail a little and found a nice big boulder on the other side of the river to sit on.  We figured we'd wait there, drinking our milkshakes, for the other two to come out.  Just after 3pm there were a pair of through trail runners coming out of the enchantments so we asked if they had seen them.  No sign so we figured we'd come back at 4:30 to see if Sara and Matt were down.  I updated the note I left at the trailhead with the new time and we went back to camp.  We took a quick a nap at camp and then headed back to the parking lot.  Still no sign but some climbers got back so we asked them and they said the two were waiting at the top, so we finally assumed they'd be getting a ride back with Luke.  Still not wanting to strand them, I updated the note that I'd be back at 6:30 in case they weren't back at camp yet.

			Back at camp Josh had gotten the brisket going and everyone was filtering in, sharing their adventures from the day.  Everyone returned from Outer Space so thankfully I didn't need to make another trip back to the parking lot.  Bill took good care of the fire as always and we relaxed in its warmth for the rest of the night.  Sunday morning we slept in and grabbed breakfast in town.  We decided to try some new areas near Sam Hill so after some navigating, we found our way to the Boneyard.  The area was very dirty with moss and pine needles.  Aaron led Chiller (5.8), a mostly sport route with some interesting moves on the dirty rock.  Aaron did manage to sort of wiggle in a few pieces of gear in the larger runout between bolts.  Monica and Gloria dropped a rope on Skeletal Remains (5.9).  The beginning was carpeted in moss so many of us took some time trying to clear off foot and hand holds.  I spent a bunch of time scraping as much off as I could.  The beginning was fairly straight forward, not including the moss, but the upper section had some more challenging moves, especially the exit over the bulge.  Matt and Sasha had gotten a rope dropped on Robin Hood (5.10-), a delicate face climb with a small ledge/roof to pull over.  It was thin and challenging, but sort of fun.

			After everyone had climbed those routes we packed up and headed for Ski Tracks.   Aaron was getting ready to lead it when he and Matt noticed bees in the crack.  We had heard it's generally filled with bees but were hoping being later in the year they might be gone - no such luck.  We continued on up to Underhill instead.  Monica started by leading Jaywalking for Jesus (5.8).  It was a really fun climb with some interesting moves and a traverse with ok feet and a nice hand crack at the top.  That was probably my favorite route of the day.  Matt led Don't Forget Arete (5.9), another challenging climb.  I followed Monica's strategy and stayed more on the arete, others smeared more on the face and did some liebacking.  It was a fun route though.  Monica had dropped a rope on the anchors next to Don't Forget Arete, but as Matt was the first one to climb up, he soon realized there were bees in those cracks as well.  He quickly lowered and pulled the rope, so I cleaned the anchor from the top of Don't Forget Arete (there's a large ledge to walk around on), and then cleaned the route I was on as well.  After that we packed up and grabbed burgers in town.  It was a nice, sunny fall weekend in Leavenworth for some climbing.  It's always fun to try some new routes while spending time with friends.
