			Aaron's parents were in town along with Vicki, so we decided to head out on Saturday to take advantage of the nice weather and hike somewhere.  Aaron had the Commonwealth Basin in mind, mostly Kendall Katwalk with the summit as an add-on.  I did a bit of reading on Summit Post and the summer trail up Red Mountain didn't sound that much more difficult with some class 2/3 scrambling and an extra 300 feet in elevation gain, so I convinced the group to head up that instead.  In fact, round trip distance was a couple miles shorter than heading up Kendall.  We picked Vicki up downtown just before 8:30a and headed for Snoqualmie Pass.  The lower parking lot was full but we easily found a spot in the upper parking lot.  We had water, sandwiches, and shotbloks for everyone in their own flash pack, so after those and the trekking poles were distributed, we hit the trail.

			We took the old, abandoned Commonwealth Basin trail again to shave a couple miles off of our round trip distance.  The first section is narrow through the brush, as is typical, and then we hit the couple of steeper sections before leveling off and reaching the log crossing.  There were a couple of groups we encountered on this section of the trail, but overall it was pretty quiet.  The trail was a bit muddy in sections, more so than I was assuming although it did rain the previous couple of days.

			We made it across the next bigger stream crossing by hopping on rocks, then we hit the trail junction to Red Mountain.  Before we continued on I wanted to make sure the group was still ok with heading up Red Mountain instead of Kendall Peak but everyone seemed up for the challenge of Red so we continued on.  We followed the fairly level trail through the meadow, to one final stream crossing - this one involving a few logs, all of which moved and teetered.  Everyone made it across just fine and we started the uphill portion of the hike.  After the initial up section we found a relatively flat section of the trail to take  a break to shed some layers, sunscreen before breaking out of the trees, and make sure everyone had a little food and water.

			We were back on the trail, making steady progress up.  We were starting to get more views through little pockets in the trees, getting our first glimpses of Snoqualmie Mountain, Lundin Peak, and Mount Rainier in the distance.  It was a beautiful day and we couldn't wait for the views from the top.  We met a couple heading down with their dog, as we switchbacked up to the bench.  We stopped quick at the bench before starting up the last half mile and 900' in elevation, to grab another snack to help fuel ourselves.

			We met a group heading down from Lundin just before starting off on the trail.  The lower part of the trail is easy to follow, but the entire last half mile is steep, or 'efficient'.  About a third of the way up we started to encounter more rocks on the trail, mostly small ones, but we had to occasionally head up some blocky terrain.  For the most part it was fairly easy to continue to follow the trail.  When in doubt we could generally locate the next section above us, or if we couldn't see it above us, as we continued on what we could see the next section would reveal itself to us.

			With about 300' left to the summit, we encountered the steeper scrambling section, heading up slabs of rock intermixed with lots of steep, loose rock.  At about 150' we followed the trail through a stand of trees, and had a view of the top.  There was a trail that traversed across the slope, then we stuck to the right fork - although they both met higher up.  This last 100' or so was over lots of loose rock so we stepped carefully.

			Aaron and I reached the top first and enjoyed the great views.  AS the rest of the crew made it, I took a few pictures of both the group and the views, then we enjoyed our summit PB&amp;J sandwiches before heading down.  We took it slow, butt scooching and crouching a lot.  Various rocks did get dislodged but always came to rest within 50'.  We carefully picked our way down, mostly sticking to the trail we took up.  Once below the top 300', we were able to start picking up the trail sections, until we were finally on the established trail.

			We made much better time down from there, and stopped for a quick break back at the bench so we could regroup before heading down. We made steady progress down the remaining few miles to the trailhead, navigating all of the creek crossings for a second time.  We met a few groups heading in, but overall it was a fairly quiet day on the trail which was nice.  By the number of cars at the trailhead, I'm guessing the Katwalk was pretty busy.  7 hours after starting we were back at the car, changing into some clean clothes and looking forward to our ice cream stop on the way home.  It was a fun day in the mountains, climbing a peak for the first time during the summer - it's always fun to see what the differences are from a winter ascent.
