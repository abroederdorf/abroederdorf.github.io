			<h1>Cedar Butte 9.7.14</h1>
			
			<p>
			Alicia wanted to get out for a short, dog friendly hike close by.  After much searching on WTA, we settled on Twin Falls - only to find out the normal trailhead is closed.  I thought the hike in on the Iron Horse trail would be kind of boring so I switched the plans to Cedar Butte.  We made it through the crowds heading to Rattlesnake and easily found a spot at the Iron Horse/John Wayne trailhead at 11a.  We started up the trail, passing a few other hikers and several people biking.  After about a mile we found the trail for Cedar Butte and started gaining some elevation.  Up we went through the very green trees, until we found the fork in the trail.  I had read the right fork led to the Boxley overlook, where a powerdam back in the early 1900's broke and destroyed a logging community.  We decided to take that on the way up and head back down the more direct route.  We made it to the overlook but couldn't find what we were suppose to be looking at.  The trail had a lot of great signage which was helpful so we knew where the overlook was at least.  We continued on, meeting back up with the main trail just before starting up the switchbacks to the top.

			I kept thinking we were there, only to find another switchback.  The almost two mile trek to the top was apparently too long for me to handle.  We finally crested the butte and found the geo marker along with a tiny bench, at an empty summit.  We snapped some pictures of the mountains east of us along I-90, through our little window in the trees.  Tony got some water and snacks while the rest of us (mostly me) enjoyed some summit candy.

			After hanging out for a while at our private summit, another hiker and her dog arrived.  We figured it was time to get going so we grabbed our packs and headed down the more direct trail, cutting a half mile from our return hike.  The descent went quickly and we were back on the Iron Horse trail in no time, heading back to the cars.  It was a great day to be out in the mountains, and a fun little hike to stretch the legs but still get back to town to do some leading and climbing at the gym.
