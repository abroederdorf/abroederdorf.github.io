			<h1>Granite Mountain 12.13.14</h1>
			
            <p>
                We had another sunny weekend on our hands and I was finally feeling well enough to get out, so we picked out a hike since there wasn't enough snow to be out skiing.  In the interest of a short drive with good exercise Sara suggested Granite Mountain, which she's hiked several times but I've only been up once.  I got to sleep in a little extra versus a highway 2 hike so it sounded like a good option to me.  I picked her up about 7am and we headed out on I-90, hitting patches of intermittent light rain - unexpected as I didn't remember any rain in the forecast.  Sara checked NOAA and noted a now 20% chance of intermittent showers.  We pulled into the trailhead and joined several other cars already there, with plenty of space for more cars though.  We grabbed our gear and were on the trail just after 8am.

                The first 50 feet or so of the trail was a mud pit, but luckily after that things got better.  The trail is straightforward to follow and soon we were at the trail junction for Pratt and Granite.  We took a break so I could grab some food and then we continued right to head towards Granite, breaking out into the gully more often.  It was snow free on our first switchback in the gully, but that changed as we gained elevation.  Around 3300' the first hints of snow along the side of the trail were seen, but we probably didn't hit more solid snow until just below 4000'.  I always find a fresh layer of snow on trees to be so pretty so I documented them as such.  I guess it really has been a long time since I've been out in the snow!

                One benefit of having such little snow is not having to worry about avy danger in the gully.  I quite enjoyed switchbacking up the gully where we had some views of the surrounding snowy trees.  Unfortunately there were low hanging clouds obscuring the nearby mountains.  As we'd duck into the trees&nbsp;occasionally, they rained on us from the melting snow on their branches - not&nbsp;my favorite.  Luckily that was the only type of rain we encountered all day, plus a light snow in the meadow during our descent.

                Soon we had left the gully and were heading across the meadow with a less steep elevation gain, a nice little break to let my legs recover a bit.  Everything was covered in snow although the grass was still poking through.  The trail/bootpack was easy to follow minus the one rock I slipped on.

                The clouds kept hiding the sun from us but it was shining on the lookout tower above.  I was ready to be done several times along the trail but we continued up at my slow pace, taking lots of breaks.  Finally we curved around to the back side of Granite Mountain and had the last steep section to the lookout tower in view.

                There were a couple of big groups heading down as we started up.  We headed up the boulders east of the lookout tower, following the bootpack already in place.  The boulders do not have a solid cover of snow so it was a bit interesting trying to watch foot placement to make sure you didn't take a header into them.  We made it up, found an open patch of snow along the ridge, and settled in for some lunch.

                Despite my big puffy and mittens, my hands started to go numb so that was our sign to head down after a nice break.  We saw some people head down west of the lookout tower, along the usual summer route, so we decided to go down that figuring it couldn't be worse than heading up all of the boulders.  It was a bit slick but we made it down without much issue, definitely the better way to go.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bootpack was more consolidated and slick as we descended after all of the traffic on it, so we decided to finally pull out the microspikes as we hit the meadow.  They weren't necessary but nice to help speed the descent as I didn't have to worry about sliding or slipping as much.  We met several groups on their way up throughout our descent, even as it was only a couple hours from sunset.  As the snow coverage started getting thinner and finally when the snow started balling up on my microspikes, we stopped to take them off and strap them to our packs.  Then we continued down the mostly snow free trail to the car.  We made it back down to the car just under 6 hours from when we had left.  It was a nice day to get out and fun to do something a bit more relaxed, i.e. at my pace.
