			<h1>Bandera Mountain 3.9.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			Looking at the weather forecast on Monday, an attempt on Mount Hood over the weekend looked promising.  There was a big snow predicted Wednesday so we'd have to see what came of that and how avalanche conditions were affected, and of course, the nice weather forecast generally turns bad between Monday and Friday so we'd have to keep our eye on that as well.  I was pretty pumped about the prospect of climbing Mount Hood, which could be my first volcano summit and a great way to kick off the Year of the Volcano.  I really want to get that ticked off my list before taking on Mount Rainier, and it'd be nice to have done before Mount Baker even, which although smaller, has more elevation gain.  Tuesday night I was going to put away my gear from our hike up Mount Washington on Saturday, but instead decided to just gather everything I'd need for Mount Hood.  I resisted actually packing it up and decided to wait until later in the week since we still had plenty of time for the weather forecast to change several times.  Wednesday brought snow and the conditions report at Timberline on Friday said they had received 19" of snow in the past 72 hours, 9" in the past 48 hours, and 0" in the past 24 hours.  Avalanche conditions were moderate.  Thursday I stayed home from work sick with a bad chest cold.  Luckily, after sleeping the day away, I was feeling a lot better.  I still had a bad cough but I was feeling way more energetic.  Unfortunately I had gotten Aaron sick and he quickly got worse as Friday went on.  Friday night after we had our pasta dinner we made the tough decision to stick around Seattle instead of trying to climb Mount Hood with one sick person getting better and another getting worse. We'll just have to keep waiting for another good weather window before heading down.

			Not wanting to waste a sunny day in the mountains on Saturday, I quickly checked trip reports and figured I'd head down I-90 for another training hike to Mount Defiance or Bandera Mountain.  Bin had posted a trip report from that day to Mount Defiance so assuming there would be some good steps waiting, I planned to head up that as well.  He had parked off of Exit 42 along I-90 and hiked up the old Mason Creek trail to reach the Ira Spring Trailhead on FS 9031.  He posted a picture showing some snow in the parking lot but nothing to bad.  The forest service website listed FS 9030 and 9031 as not being cleared of snow.  Not wanting to challenge the snow with my car, I decided to follow Bin's lead and park off of Exit 42 as well.  There was a nice creek that created a good handle to follow up to the road so I wasn't too nervous about a potential bushwhack up.  I intended this to be another training hike too, so I figured an extra 600 or so feet would be good.  I quickly put away most of the gear I had gathered earlier in the week and threw together a day pack.  Not having much in it, and considering it was a training hike, I decided to bring some extra water.  I ended up with 6.5 liters than I normally bring, sending my pack weight up to 33 pounds.  I found an old map of the area and was set for a Saturday adventure in the mountains.  It had been almost a year and a half since I went off in the mountains for a day by myself, and now (post hike) maybe I think there's a reason for that.  I didn't quite expect the adventure I was about to embark.
			</p>
			<p>
			I woke up at 6AM and was on the road by 6:20AM.  It was super foggy but as I headed east on I-90 the fog lifted and it was sunny, just as the weather forecast had promised.  I parked off of Exit 42, geared up, and hit the trail about 7:20AM.  I soon wandered into the trees and found the trail.

			I rather enjoyed the Mason Creek trail.  It was really green and there were many creeks with little waterfalls.

			Luckily there were ferns and moss everywhere so the faint dirt trail was easier to follow.  There were also ribbons periodically tied on the trees so I had a fairly nice trail to follow up.

			Many pictures of all the waterfalls and green later, I found myself at the road a few hundred feet from the trailhead.  The road did have two tire ruts filled with ice in the midst of some taller snow.  Vinni may have made it but I was OK be safer and hiking up the extra bit.  There were only two cars parked at the trailhead when I arrived.  I took the opportunity to sit on the nice rocks to take a quick break and get some Gu before starting off on the real trail.

			The first part of the Ira Springs Trail is along an old road so it was nice and wide.  It was dirt down low but before long turned to a snow covering.  I passed a few more waterfalls and one group of three guys on their way down as I made my way up the tree lined trail.

			I got a few glimpses of some of the mountains across the way - it was a beautiful day.  The sun was so bright that I got my sunglasses out to put on my head.  The trail was mostly in the trees but for the small pockets where I emerged from the trees, it was nice to have the sunglasses.

			The trail left the old road and followed a more traditional hiking trail.  There wasn't as much of a boot pack as I expected, and at some points I chose the wrong faint prints and had to hike uphill a bit to catch the real trail.  I was still in my boots as the trail was pretty firm.  After the switchbacks I found two guys taking a break in the sun along the trail with their snowshoes on.  I carried on and soon came to a shaded slope that was very icy.  With no steps across and being too icy for me to get any good steps kicked in, I decided it was time to put my snowshoes on too.  Alicia had lent me her nice MSR ones to try out on Mount Hood.  They are lighter than the two pairs we have and in my opinion, have a better crampon/spike set up.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I started front pointing across the slope, making my way very slowly.  The guys caught up and I was tired of my slow traverse so I decided to go up which seemed easier to me, or at least less nerve racking.  I didn't have a chance to put up the heel risers so I quickly ascended the slope to a small roll, or as quickly as I move.  Once above the initial section I looked up to see a wide open mountainside.

			It was in the sun, but there was already an avalanche debris field from a small one that must have been set off the day before.  I looked at the few sparse trees to my left and decided to head straight up the avalanche debris field.  I figured it had already slid so it'd be my best bet.  The snow was pretty frozen and I started making steady progress up with the snowshoes and heel risers (thank goodness for those little bars!).  I started counting steps, finding that put my in a better rhythm, taking longer between each break.  The sun, having been up for a few hours at this point, made me a little nervous with the slope.  The higher I got, the more patches of soft stuff I found.  My foot would occasionally slip out on the snow.  I had brought my new ice axe for the first time and decided part way up, after I kicked my feet in to get a good footing, it was time to get it out.  I held that in my right hand while I had my two trekking poles in my left hand - I didn't think to put one away and didn't want to risk taking my pack off again.  I saw things sliding down the hillside and wanted to avoid that.

			The slope was fairly steep, in my humble opinion, so I just tried making steady progress.  Through some of the smaller, softest sections I high daggered to provide myself an added sense of security.  As I got higher I noticed a ridge I couldn't see before, heading down and to the left.  I realized that was the ridge I had intended on hitting and I was going to be intercepting it much higher and farther east than I wanted.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I finally reached the ridge and breathed a sigh of relief.  I grabbed some water, put my ice axe away, and checked my GPS. Later, from my GPS track, I'd learn that I had gone up just over 1300' in about a quarter mile, no wonder I needed a break.  I was indeed part way up the ridge on Bandera so I figured I'd finish the last 500' up to the false summit.  Luckily the views were awesome from the ridge and I knew they'd only be better from the top.  That was my motivation to get up the last 500', that, and a proper break for some food and water.  The snow was getting softer with the top couple inches easily sliding. I was glad to almost be to the top.  Finally I reached the false summit, and looking at the ridge traverse I'd still have to do to reach the true summit, decided to call it quits where I was.  I took some great photos of the mountains, with a great view of Mount Rainier and even a shadowy Mount Adams in the distance.  I checked out the ridge up to Mount Defiance with Mason Lake below.  I decided I had done enough for the day and I'd save it for another day.

			I sat down to eat the sausage and cheese I had brought up with me.  I didn't want to head back down/slide down the open face I had come up, knowing the sun was only softening it more, so I decided I'd head down the ridge and find the trail I was suppose to take up originally.  Right before I left I emptied the 6 liters of water from my pack.  My pack was practically empty, it felt good.
			</p>
			<p>
			I started down the ridge in my snowshoes but was sliding a lot on the snow.  After employing some green belays I decided it was time to stash the snowshoes and take my chances plunge stepping.  The snow seemed to have softened up enough for it compared to what I had encountered in the morning.  I strapped the snowshoes on my pack as two guys passed me on their way up the ridge.  Plunge stepping was awesome.  There was the wet, loose snow on top with a somewhat icy section under that - perfect for some quick plunge stepping.  After encountering only a couple groups on the way up, I met many more groups on the way down.  There was a scout troop heading up to the lake that I directed towards the correct ridge.  They had kicked some nice steps that I was happy to follow down.  I soon made it down to that icy traverse that had sent me straight up the mountain in the morning.  There was a large group crossing so I just kicked some steps below them, quite a difference in snow conditions after a few hours in the sun.  Once across that I knew it was trail the rest of the way out so I stopped to strap my ice axe back on my pack and get my other trekking pole out.  I started down the trail, happy to be heading home.  I passed several groups heading up, stopping to chat with many of them and answer questions about conditions.  
			</p>
			<p>
			For some reason I stopped to check my snowshoes.  I could reach behind and feel one, but not the other.  I quickly took my pack off and discovered I had lost a snowshoe.  <bad words="">  My decision to head back up was quick.  I had to go find Alicia's other snowshoe.  I soon caught up with some of the groups I had passed and explained my story.  They were sympathetic and said they'd keep an eye out for the blue snowshoe.  I started up, checking down the hillside looking for any slide that might indicate where the snowshoe had gone.  A few groups were headed down that I had passed earlier so I asked them about the missing snowshoe, but no one had seen it.  I figured I had about 1000' to go find it, but then I realized that was where I had put my ice axe on my pack, I had strapped the snowshoes on up a lot higher, about 1500' up from where I discovered I was missing one.  I couldn't believe I didn't notice the missing snowshoe when I strapped my ice axe back on, apparently I was not very observant.

			I met the two guys I had seen earlier heading up Bandera.  They were my best hope in finding the lost snowshoe since they were coming from the top, assuming it hadn't gone careening over the side and off the trail somewhere.  They told me a couple had picked it up and the woman had it strapped to her pack and was bringing it down.  I was ecstatic, I could at least stop worrying about finding it.  I continued heading up to intercept the wonderful couple that had the snowshoe.  They were almost as excited to find me as I was them.  They said they had already been trying to figure out how to leave notes at the trailhead, on WTA, etc to find the owner of the lonesome snowshoe.  I happily took it from them, triple strapped it to my pack, and started down.  A couple of the guys I had met again on the way up were sorry they couldn't help because they had taken a short cut down, via a glissade chute.  I just happened to intercept the couple right by the top of the glissade chute they used.  After checking my GPS to make sure I'd hit the main trail below, I decided to glissade too.  I had hiked that section of the trail up twice and down once already, I really didn't need to hike down it again.  I got to drop a little over 500' via glissading, that definitely helped cheer me up a bit.  I took off down the trail, checking I still had both snowshoes every so often.  I made it back to a much fuller trailhead than what I encountered in the morning.  Now I just had the old Mason Creek trail down to my car before I could finally head home.

			I was super excited to get back to my car finally, with all my gear, about 3:30PM - 8 hours after I had left that morning.  I changed into some dry, happy clothes and hit the road back to Seattle.  I got a little more training than I was expecting but I guess that's not a bad thing, and I got to get out in the mountains to enjoy a beautiful day.  I also learned how to more securely attach my snowshoes.  Overall it was a good day but I was happy to get home and relax.

				<p class="tab2">Story Time:
				<br>1 - About the time I realized I was short a snowshoe
				<br>2 - 3: The area I lost my snowshoe.  According to the couple, it was up pretty high so I'm guessing closer to 2
				<br>3: The spot I got the snowshoe back
				<br>Up - The trail I decided to forge up the open face through the avalanche debris
				<br>Glissade - Awesome glissade chute the scout troop made, that helped make my day after my worried hiking back up.  Nothing like sliding down several hundred feet to raise the spirits</p>
