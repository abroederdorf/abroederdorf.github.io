			<h1>Mount Adams - South Route 7.27 - 7.28.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			As we were still catching our breath (or at least I was) from finishing the St Urho 10K, part of the Midsummer festivities in Menahga last summer, Aaron began hatching a climbing plan.  He started talking relatives into coming out to climb with us.  During the following months, the group formed and Aaron's Dad, Jeff, and his Dad's cousin's husband, Mike, decided to come out and join us.  Anticipating having several Minnesota flat landers joining us, we decided Mount Adams would be a great objective.  Aaron had never climbed it, I had only made it as far as the false summit, and it had a non-technical route we could head up so we wouldn't have to worry about glacier travel with the less experienced climbers.  It still posed a great challenge being the second highest mountain in Washington with a great camping plan for acclimating.  The next challenge was trying to pick a weekend that would be good.  Needing to book airfare months before a weather forecast would be available, we decided a weekend late in July would be our best bet.  We were hoping to avoid some rain but not wait too late in the season that we'd miss the awesome 2000' glissade down.  We decided on July 27 and 28th, which became a celebration weekend for BOEALPS.  It's the club's 50th year so as one of the many events to celebrate, the club challenged members to climb 50 peaks for 50 years in one weekend.  Aaron signed us up to climb Mount Adams, and the week of the climb we picked up our summit sign and commemorative neck gaiters.

			Jeff and Mike flew out Thursday afternoon so they’d have time to pack on Friday and run to REI to pick up any last minute items.  Between all of our gear and with help from Sara and Matt, we were basically able to fully outfit them which was nice.  The three guys picked me up from work Friday afternoon about 1:30PM to start on the five hour drive to the trailhead.  After a quick stop for some alpine Jimmy John's (#4 was the popular choice), we hit the road.  We were foolish to think that leaving early Friday afternoon meant we'd get to avoid traffic on I-5 south.  We slowly crawled with hundreds of other cars (thank goodness Aaron got the A/C in his jeep fixed!) as we made our way south.  Finally, south of Olympia, the traffic subsided and we started making better progress.  We stopped near the state border for some burritos and then headed east.  Traffic was not fun but at least we got some good views of Mt Rainier, Mt St Helens, Mt Adams, Mt Hood, and the Columbia River along the way. Eventually we arrived at the ranger station in Trout Lake to self register and pick up some of their fancy blue bags, complete with targets and kitty litter. Based on current conditions reports, we knew the road to the trailhead was rough.  I got to drive since I get car sick and I was glad to be driving the jeep up with it's high clearance.  We rolled into a very busy Cold Springs campground (~5560’) but lucked out and found a parking spot right next to the trailhead. As the sun had just set, we quickly found a place for our four person tent and set up camp for the night.

			We woke up about 6am Saturday to eat some breakfast, pack up camp, and finish packing the backpacks. The trailhead was pretty busy and we saw lots of groups file past us. We hit the trail a few minutes after 8am and started the hike up to Lunch Counter, our intended camping spot for Saturday night.

			It was a gorgeous day which meant plenty of sunshine and great views of Mount Hood as we made our way up the dusty trail. The lower section, which was burnt in a wildfire last fall, was a little surreal. It was quite the contrast with the normal alpine setting I'm used to seeing.

			Mike was doing a great job of staying hydrating based on my recommendation, so when we came upon a stream, we stopped to filter some water. There were several groups we leapfrogged with along the trail, one in particular fueled by Coors and carrying a large American Flag.  It's always fun to see the characters on the mountain.  There were several large cairns along the way, besides a well defined trail, so navigation was a non issue.

			The trail was snow free (and very dusty) until about 7400’, a lot less snow than the first time I had been in there. After making our way up some loose choss, we hit our first snow slope.  Jeff and Mike had worn running shoes in, and seeing that we'd be back on a ridge just above the slope, we encouraged the guys to wait to change into their boots.  Aaron started up the boot pack first to help improve the steps and I followed behind.  On our way we saw a couple marmots make their way down the slope, our first wildlife spotting of the weekend!

			<p>
			Before long we reached the ridge above the snow slope and I lead off at my slow pace.  The sun was burning bright and I wanted to stop to reapply sunscreen.  We figured the top of the ridge would be a great place to stop for sunscreen and lunch, so I trudged up to that at about 8,000'.

			We each picked out a good sitting rock and enjoyed the great views of Mount Hood and Mt St Helens as we enjoyed our Jimmy John's lunch.  Jeff had packed some milk and yogurt, and fearing the worse for the milk on the hot day, had that with his lunch as well.

			After about an hour break, we got ready to finish the last 1200' up to the Lunch Counter, our destination for day 1.  We were making great time and the Minnesota flat landers were doing a great job. No one was feeling any altitude effects, not even me! The snow was soft enough in the afternoon sun that we just booted up the tracks,. With all the traffic there wasn’t one well defined boot pack so we picked our way up the various sets of tracks.

			In sight of the Lunch Counter, Aaron took off ahead to scout out a camping spot for us. I brought up the rear and at about 9000’ hit a bit of an altitude wall and slowed down. I could see Aaron and Mike sitting on the rocks as Jeff and I made our way towards them, but I just couldn't go very fast.  Almost to the rocks, Aaron came down and grabbed my pack so I could finish the last 50 feet a little quicker.

			Aaron found some nice campsites at about 9500’ on the dirt, complete with rock walls, so we took those. I was happy - less work than digging out platforms and it’d be easier breaking down camp the next day, not to mention warmer and less wet. After getting the tents set up and staked out with rocks, we grabbed the water bottles, stoves, and filter and headed for the snow to start making water. 
			</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Firing up the stoves to start melting and boiling water</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We had planned to filter our water after melting it to save fuel from not boiling, but the filter wasn’t functioning well, so we were left to the slow process of melting and boiling water. A little concerned with having enough fuel, I grabbed the black garbage bag from my pack as well as the clear bags from my blue bags and we set some snow out in the sun to melt.  We also decided to treat some of our water instead of boiling it since we didn't need all of it drinkable right away.  A few hours after we started we had all of our containers filled, about 13 liters in all, which we figured would last us for the rest of the weekend.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once the water situation was under control, Aaron took Mike for a lesson in using an ice axe and walking in snow. Jeff decided a little refresher wouldn't hurt since it had been a few years since he had used his ice axe as well.  They grabbed their boots and shells and walked over to a nearby slope.

			Aaron demonstrated the four self arrest positions and Mike did great with it.  We didn't have crampons for practice, but assuming we might be using them the next day, Aaron talked about some  of the cramponing techniques too.  Having gone through all of the pertinent snow travel skills we could think of, we went back to camp to grab dinner.

			The snow in the garbage bag and blue bags had melted nicely so we boiled that for our dehydrated meals.  I actually ate most of my meal.  Other than slowing down for the last few hundred feet to camp, I was feeling pretty good.  I hadn't felt nauseous once and we were at 9500'.  My normal is to start feeling altitude somewhere between 8500 – 9200'.  Mike and Jeff were convinced they were my good luck charms.  After Mike finished off all the dehydrated meals (he was doing great for his first time up at altitude!) we made one of the desserts Aaron brought – bananas foster.  I had a few bites and have to admit it was pretty tasty.  We sauntered back to camp and enjoyed the views.

			We were as high as you could get at the Lunch Counter, practically at the base of the slope up to Pikers Peak.  That gave us a great vantage point to check out all of the other tents and activity lower at the Lunch Counter, as well as great views.  To the south we could see Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Fingered Jack, and Mount Washington.

			We even spotted smoke from a wildfire to the east. I think I was the only one that was tired so I went to bed about 8PM.  We expected to take 5 – 6 hours to summit, an hour down from the summit, an hour to pack up camp, and another three hours to the car before a five hour drive home with a dinner stop.  If we left at 5AM that would mean we'd get home about 10PM.  I set my alarm for 4AM and said good night as I was soon fast asleep in the tent.
			</p>
			<p>
			The alarm went off at 4AM, but not expecting to take long to get ready, I start rustling around about 4:15AM to eat breakfast and try to warm up a bit.  I brought my 35 degree sleeping bag with a liner but it wasn't quite warm enough for me, so Aaron unzipped his sleeping bag so we could both use it as a blanket as we ate breakfast - it definitely helped.  We finally left the tent about 4:30AM, just as the sky was starting to lighten up.

			I had gotten my pack ready the night before so I put my boots  and gaiters on, made a quick pit stop, and waited for the rest of the crew to get ready as I watched all the headlamps around us.  It was a little windy which made it cold standing around, so Aaron ducked back in his sleeping bag for a while.  I put my big puffy on which worked well.

			I was just starting to feel a little off which was my signal to get moving.  Everyone wasn't quite ready but I told Aaron I needed to go so I set off across the rocks.  We had a short walk to the snow, so I figured I could go check out the snow conditions.  There were several groups of headlamps above us on the mountain already, and numerous groups passed us as we were getting ready.  They all appeared to be wearing crampons and after a couple steps on the snow, I was convinced we had perfect cramponing conditions.  Mike followed me out of camp so we sat down to put our crampons on as Aaron and Jeff caught up.

			Everyone was ready so I started out ahead, assuming I'd be the slowest one setting the pace.  We made steady progress up and I was feeling good.  There were a lot of tracks, but a fairly defined boot pack that closely followed the glissade chute so I mostly stayed on that.  I still stuck with my stop every 30 minutes for a food and water break.  It's a lot more convenient when Sara watches the time and just tells me when to stop.  I almost like not knowing how long we've been going and how low/high we are.  I brought my MP3 player again and even though I was a lot closer to people as we hiked up, I still enjoyed having my music.

			The sun rose as we started climbing so before too long, we were out on the sunny slope. Luckily a break was coming up soon so we just made it a longer one to put sunscreen on and switch layers around a bit.  I had been wearing my puffy still but decided the sun would be warm enough.

			We were above 10,000' and everyone was still feeling great, it was awesome.  Apparently camping at almost 5600' at the trailhead and then a second night at 9500' was doing a lot of good in terms of acclimation for everyone.  I typically get hit hard by altitude but I was feeling the best I ever had above 9000’.

			We kept trudging up the steps and before too long we reached Pikers Peak, the false summit, just below 11,500’. That 2000' out of camp went a lot faster than I expected.  For the first time the guys had a clear view of the summit, which was still a traverse and about 800’ away.  This is where I had stopped on my other attempt but there was no question this time.  I was still feeling great and was looking forward to finishing the climb.

			There was a huge trough from the boot pack through a field of suncups as we made our way over to the base of the summit. The well defined boot pack continued as we started encountering the first of the climbers headed down. We switchbacked up this final slope, still mostly following glissade chutes, with a few exposed rock patches we had to walk across.

			Before long the summit was within reach.  I was feeling really good still so I sped up a bit, hoping to get pictures of Mike and Jeff as they stepped onto the summit.  I made it, and as I fumbled for my camera Mike topped out just behind me (he was nice enough to recreate the moment for a picture).  Next Jeff and Aaron topped out, and we were all standing on top!

			We successfully summited Mount Adams and were standing at 12,276'! This was Mike’s first summit and thus his highest; it was my highest summit; and Aaron and Jeff’s second highest summit as they had climbed Mount Rainier together in 2009. We made it to the summit in just under four hours after leaving camp which averages to over 700' an hour, much faster than I expected to move or have ever moved that high up!  It was very busy on top and also quite windy so it was a little chilly.  A couple got engaged while we were up there - apparently it's engagement/wedding season on the volcanoes (a couple got married at Camp Schurman during our last Rainier attempt a couple weeks prior).  We got our BOEALPS summit picture with our sign and neck gaiters, and then Aaron pulled out his surprise for Mike.

			Since I had a couple of numb fingers, I suggested we start down a little to get out of the wind before taking our summit break to grab some food.  As we chowed down a little, we saw a few people head down the glissade chutes, so we decided to as well. Since we reached the summit in 2/3s the time we expected, it was still a little early in the day for the snow to really soften up in the chutes. We put away our crampons and started down the icy glissade chutes anyways. Even though conditions weren’t exactly great for glissading, we still chose it over walking down. Mike loved glissading and did it every chance he got. We glissaded down from the summit, walked the traverse back to Pikers Peak, and got ready for the almost 2000’ glissade back to camp. The chutes were well used with many high sides like a water slide. The icy conditions made for a fast glissade, and provided many bruises as I bounced off the icy wall with my right arm which I was using to keep my ice axe dug in, in hopes of retaining some control during the glissade.

			Enjoying the quick descent down, we decided to keep up the momentum and packed up camp instead of taking a break.  We then set 
			off in search of our next glissade.

			We found a couple more, taking us back down to 8000', where we had stopped for lunch the day before.  At the top of the ridge there was another glissade chute.  On the way up we chose the rocks, but if we could glissade down we'd do it.  Aaron checked out the chute and said it looked like it went, so we all started down.  It was by far the most challenging glissade as the chute closely followed the rocks.  There was one large drop off over a rock and several other small rocks in the chute.  However, it was worth the effort and we were soon at about 7400', just under 2000’ to the trailhead.

			We arrived back at the car about 2PM, two hours ahead of schedule. Some celebratory cookies, drinks, and clean dry clothes were the highlights at the car.  It was a beautiful weekend to be out in the mountains with a great group of people, not only getting the Minnesotans out to enjoy the amazing mountains we have in Washington but also to help celebrate BOEALPS 50th anniversary.  I got to claim my second volcano of the year, my highest ever summit at #2 on the Washington top 100 list, and I felt great throughout the trip – a big success in my book!
