			<h1>Mount Rainier - Emmons-Winthrop Attempt 7.13 - 7.15.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			In 15 days time Sara and I had climbed four Washington Top 100 peaks (#24, #4, #59, #25), put in about 37 miles and 23,400' in elevation gain.  Within 7 days alone we had done about 17,500' of that elevation gain, so why not go climb the highest mountain in the state the next weekend?  Breaks are for whimps? No, they're for smart people who don't try to kill themselves, unfortunately we are notorious for making terrible life decisions - always with good intentions though.  With a good weather forecast for the weekend, Sara started planning our third trip to Mount Rainier this year.  We didn't make it past Camp Schurman on the first trip due to high winds, and the weather for the second trip turned south right before the weekend so we bailed and climbed Mount Baker instead.  Mount Rainier was Sara's biggest objective this year, so here we were again trying to assemble a team while Sara checked in with the rangers a few times a day to get a count on available permits and route conditions.  Luke (aka Tiger Shark) was in for another volcano climb with Sara and I; Erica was in again (she even changed her birthday plans to join!); Aubrey joined; and we needed to find one more to avoid the awkward five person rope team in favor of two teams of three.  Sara's boss had taken the Washington Alpine Club's basic climbing class this year and suggested one of the guys from the class with her, Waqas.  Our teams were assembled and group gear figured out. Luckily Aaron outfitted most of our needs with Chris chipping in a tent as well.  After having tried the Emmons-Winthrop route on our first attempt this year, this time we were hoping to head up the DC with our first night at Camp Muir and the second at Ingraham Flats, the best possible acclimation plan for us with altitude issues.  The DC has more objective hazards in my opinion, but worth the risk if we could leave from Ingraham flats at 11,100' instead of Camp Schurman at 9,400'.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Sara called the ranger station several times on Friday to get an idea of permit availability.  Fortunately the weather was gorgeous that weekend for a summit attempt, unfortunately that meant everyone was on the mountain and there weren't many permits to be had.  Sara called right before the Climbing Information Center closed Friday night and found out for Saturday night, there was 1 spot at Ingraham Flats, 4 spots at Camp Muir, and 13 spots on the Muir Snowfield.  Sunday, when we wanted to be at Ingraham Flats there weren't enough spots for our group of six so the best we could do was Camp Muir.  On the east side of the mountain on the Emmons route, there was a group spot at Camp Curtis at about 9000' or 12 spots at the Emmons flats at about 9500' Saturday night, and tons of openings at all of the camps Sunday night.  Given that information, my opinion was to head up the Emmons-Winthrop route.  Starting from Camp Muir or Camp Schurman/Emmons flats is pretty similar (500' difference) so I didn't think it was much of an advantage to go to Camp Muir.  Also, we wouldn't have to worry about rock fall through Cathedral Gap or a high chance of traffic jams around the cleaver or any other choke point feature since it was so busy.  The Inter Glacier also had that nice 2000' glissade down.  After discussing all this and our potential for getting permits, we decided to switch to the Emmons-Winthrop route.  The White River ranger station opened at 7am, an hour after the Climbing Information center at Paradise.  People can get permits for anywhere on the mountain from either of those stations, so we still had to get down to Paradise early in the morning and then drive part way around the mountain to get to the White River Campground.  We decided we'd send one car and have the other sleep in a little and meet us at 8am at the trailhead.  Since Luke is used to waking up early for work, Sara and I rode down with him, leaving Seattle at 3am to get to the center by time it opened at 6am.  We arrived in the parking lot about 5:25am and walked over to the Climbing Information Center.  No one was there yet so we sat in the little hallway out of the cold and waited.  About 5:40am more people showed up and our line started to grow.  Good call on getting there so early!  Robert, the ranger, came down at 6am and opened up.  He told everyone the situation and said to be patient, he'd do his best to get people on the mountain.  Sara quickly claimed six spots at the Emmons flats so we had permits for the weekend!  After filling out all the paperwork and getting a conditions report from Robert the ranger, we got back in the car for the hour drive around the mountain.

			We stopped for a pit stop just past the ranger station and as we were standing in the parking lot the other car drove up, perfect timing!  We drove the rest of the way to the trailhead to a full parking lot so we pulled off along the side of the road.  As we were getting ready, Evan, a guy that I work with and saw on Mount Baker a couple weeks prior, was there too!  Small world and the first of many familiar faces we'd see on our hike up.  We got ready and hit the trail about 8:30am.  Sara was running out ahead so I took over lead to slow the pace down a bit.  We were making good progress until we started discussing tenting arrangements.  We had sent one EV-2 with Aubrey and Erica to share, one with Luke and Waqas to share, and Sara and I had the Direkt-2.  Luke's group gear included a rope and tent poles.  I had brought a few other pieces of gear for him so I had it all in a duffel bag.  I didn't check that he had grabbed everything when we left the cars, and we soon discovered he didn't have the tent poles.  Being a couple miles up the trail, we decided we needed them.  There was no way we could squeeze three people into the Direkt-2 and one EV-2 for two nights.  Luke had worn some trail runners up and since the poles were in his car, he went back to go get them.  After a brief chase we confirmed he did have his keys, so we sat down on the side of the trail to wait.  About 15 minutes later we spotted Luke coming back up the trail, man was he fast!  Turns out he had run into a bear, almost literally.  He came around a corner and stopped a couple feet short of a bear, who turned and growled at him, so he high tailed it back up to us to ask for a buddy to head down with him.  Waqas graciously volunteered, so armed with trekking poles they set off.  We were on a shady part of the trail and starting to get a little chilly, so we decided to move up the trail until we could find some sun to sit in.  We put our packs on and then I grabbed Luke's bag while Sara had Waqas's bag.  We slowly waddled our way up the trail with 80 - 90 pounds hanging on us.  There were some large groups passing by just then and we provided quite the spectacle for them.

			With a nice sunny spot secured, we settled in for a couple hours while the guys retrieved the forgotten tent poles.  Eventually they appeared, a little surprised we had relocated about 5 minutes up the trail.  After letting them rest a bit, we started off again.  We were almost to Glacier Basin, and before long we popped out of the last of the trees for the trip.  We passed another group of BOEALP-ers on their way down, Chuck, who we had climbed Unicorn with a couple years ago and Will, who I had played flag football with a few years ago.  Funny the people you see out in the mountains.  Glacier Basin looked a lot different from a month prior when we headed in, a lot less snow.  We had to stay up high on the dirt this time to get to the end of the basin before heading up the Inter Glacier.  It was pretty warm out, so we filled up with water at the stream.

			We had a little over 2500' up to the top of the Inter Glacier.  There was a boot pack already established so at least we didn't have to kick steps this time.  I started out in front but was soon kicked to the back of the line.  I was feeling fatigued, a little light headed, and in general had a lack of energy, so I started falling farther behind the group.

			<p>
			Finally I had to sit and take a break at about 8000'.  I started up again, and after realizing how far back I was, the rest of the group took a break to wait for me to catch up.  The last 500' to the ridge was a killer for me, I just wasn't feeling all that great.  I stayed at the back and tried to keep up the best I could.

			We soon hit the ridge and had a hundred feet or so up, before we'd rope up and head down to the glacier to make our way up the last 400' to Camp Schurman. I just couldn't quite make it to the top of the ridge before sitting and resting again.  Once towards the top, we went and sat on the exposed rocks.

			Our nice snowy path down to the glacier now included exposed, loose rock/dirt.  Sara scoped it out so we could decide when to rope up.  We didn't need to be roped up for the rock crossing, but there wasn't much room at the bottom to do it either so we decided to rope up where we were, and just coil the rope up and carrying it to stay close together on the rocks.  It was a bit cold in the wind on the ridge so I grabbed my shell and mittens.  After our success on Mount Baker, Sara wanted to keep our rope team the same so she led off with Luke in the middle and me bringing up the rear. Waqas led the second rope as he was the next most experienced with glacier travel, with Erica in the middle, and Aubrey bringing up the rear.  With our tent pole break, it was a lot later in the day than we had hoped.  In reality the Emmons Flats are maybe 15 or 20 minutes above Camp Schurman, but I was really hoping we could talk our way into staying at camp even though it was full.  On the way up to camp I felt the three p's - I felt like I could pass out, puke, and poop all at the same time.  I trudged up on the back of our rope as we crossed a sketchy little snow bridge into Camp Schurman.

			The rangers were just getting back into camp at the same time so Sara talked to them, and they said as long as we were kind/quiet neighbors (since a lot of groups had gone to sleep) we could stay there - best news I had gotten all day.  There was one small open spot on the dirt so Sara and I took that with our Direkt-2, while the other two groups found some nearby open tent platforms for their EV-2s.

			We took over an old dug out kitchen and started melting snow for water and dinner.  I wasn't really feeling up for dinner so I just drank some water and finished off my Jimmy John's sandwich from the day.  Once everyone was fed and we had filled up all of our water containers, we retired for the night.  There was a great sunset over the mountains as I got ready for bed.  After waking up at 2:30am that morning, I was looking forward to getting to bed and was soon fast asleep.

			The night wasn't the most peaceful night of sleep but I didn't expect much different being in camp and knowing most everyone would be trying for the summit that night.  I think I woke up every hour to people leaving and coming back.  Finally about 7:30am I woke up for good and got out of the tent.  We reconvened at our adopted kitchen and sat around eating, drinking, and watching the ant-sized climbers make their way up and down the mountain.  We melted some more water to top off all of the water containers and hung out on our rest day.  As we were all sitting there, the group Sara and I were camped next to had some commotion going on.  Earlier, when I was sitting at the tent, I overheard them discussing where to have the shenanigans before they left, and they settled on the porch out front of the ranger hut.  Little did I know their 'shenanigans' was actually a wedding.  They had planned to get married at the top of Mount Rainier but one of their party members had altitude issues and they had to turn around, so they settled for Camp Schurman instead.  More and more groups filtered down and we again saw some familiar faces - Dana and Andrew, Andrew who was one or our camp neighbors on Mount Baker.  Apparently all of their girlfriends/wives climbed up the DC so they decided to head up the Emmons and they actually saw several other familiar people at the top.  Evan filtered down past us too, everyone being successful and having a great climb.  It was amusing to see some of the large groups coming down from the flats with their grocery bags full of blue bags to deposit at Camp Schurman.  I was glad we were there with the toilet instead of blue bagging it up on the flats.  My shoulder we bothering me a bit, I think from sitting in a slouched position for so long on the snow, so I spent much of the day literally laying around.  I started outside on the ground but it was a little chilly so I was the resident hermit inside my tent for most of the day.  I was still trying to eat and drink, my goal was a couple liters that day.  I had brought lots of Gatorade and Propel packets with me which definitely makes the water more tasty and provides some needed electrolytes.  After most of the groups had left camp, Aubrey, Erica, Luke, and Waqas moved their tents onto the rocks for a quicker break down on Monday.  Everyone wanted to review crevasse rescue again, so we set up a mock z-pulley on the rocks.

			After that it was about 4:00pm and we figured time to start melting more snow for water and dinner.  I managed to eat a good chunk of my chicken and rice meal.  Overall I hadn't felt too nauseous throughout the day, but I was still anxious to see how I felt on the climb the next day.  I didn't expect to feel good, it was more a matter of how terrible I could endure feeling and for how long.  We went to bed about 6:30pm and I probably fell asleep about 7pm.

			I don't think Sara slept much, if any at all - she always seemed to be awake reading when I would roll over.  Our plan was to wake up about 11:45pm in hopes of moving by 12:30am.  We were planning for 10 hours up to the summit, then the long hike back out including breaking down camp.  We all got woken up about 11pm by the wind outside.  Not again, where did the wind come from?  It was pretty strong, to the point both Sara and I felt like we were getting lifted off of the ground in the tent.  Of course our rest day was gorgeous and now our summit push was to be in high winds.  Sara yelled to the other tents and we decided to sleep for one more hour in hopes the wind would die down a bit.  Sara and I had been discussing our possibilities but upon delaying our start, I went back to sleep for a little bit.  Everyone was up again at 12:45am.  We eventually made the call to give it a try.  I told Sara I'd go until I got blown over in the wind, then I was coming back - that, or apparently after I threw up five times Erica said I could turn around.  We got ready in the wind and dark, and roped up.

			We didn't get moving from camp until 2am, an hour and a half after our original start time.  Sara started out leading the group with Waqas leading the second team close behind me.  I brought my MP3 player again, figuring it would help as I trudged up in the darkness separated from my teammates on the rope.  For as windy as it was, it was surprisingly warm.  Not hot by any means, but none of my fingers were going numb and my water wasn't freezing.  The wind wasn't very pleasant though, and the first big gust got me just as I was stepping over a crevasse on a snow bridge.  The wind definitely knocked me around and I stutter stepped a lot to regain my balance.  Sara kept our break schedule every 30 minutes since I said it helped me a lot on Mount Baker.  During breaks I would drop into a ball on the snow, to avoid getting blown over.  I somehow never got knocked off my feet so we continued making steady progress up the mountain.  Later Sara told me she got knocked off her feet a few times, but my deal to turn around was if I got knocked over which never happened.  I was feeling better than I had on Mount Baker but it still wasn't great.  I kept going through cycles of not feeling good, then feeling ok for a while.  I threw up in my mouth a bit and had some dry heaving down low, but I was determined to keep going until I had actually thrown up.  We followed the boot pack up, navigating around many open crevasses.  Leaving at 2am at least meant we had just over a couple hours in complete darkness before the sky started to light up from sunrise.

			Erica was treated to a beautiful sunrise behind us for her birthday.  About 12,000' I started feeling pretty bad again and actually stopped the group.  A lot of dry heaving eventually led to me throwing up.  I surprisingly wasn't quite ready to turn around so we kept moving up at our slow, steady pace.

			We were slowing as we got higher but that was expected.  After crossing a large crevasse by climbing up a sketchy snow bridge, we encountered our first group on their way down.

			There was one more group above us and no one behind us.  The rangers had told us they'd be leaving about lunch time that day and didn't expect anyone else to be up there.  Sara and I were both feeling the altitude and with how slow we were moving and knowing no one would be behind us in case we needed help, we decided just before 8am and about 12,700' to turn around.  The other rope team was still physically feeling better, but Waqas made the smart decision to head down with us.  This was Erica's second glacier travel experience and Aubrey hadn't done any glacier travel in a couple years, so Waqas didn't want to be up there without any other teams.  Camp Schurman looked so close below us but it still took several hours to head back down the more than 3000' we had gained that morning.

			When we arrived in camp, a guided group showed up and set up camp.  We decided to take our time packing up to give people a chance to recover a little before heading the rest of the way down.  I had brought a birthday hat and sash for Erica for our summit celebration, so I grabbed those at camp so she could descend in birthday style.

			We got everything packed up and gave the guided group the rest of our extra water since we weren't going to carry it down.  We roped back up for the final section down to the ridge.  We made it back across the rocks and took a quick break to put away all of our glacier gear.  We were at least looking forward to the glissade down, we knew it'd be good.  We did one short one, and then traversed skier's left to the middle of the slope to avoid the open crevasse we saw about 8400' on the skier's right side of the Inter Glacier.

			We had one continuous chute down and it was awesome.  With there being less snow than last time, we couldn't quite glissade as far down but it was still nice to drop over 2000' glissading.  The Rangers were boot skiing down just behind us and their skills were super impressive.  The one ranger, who we had talked to at camp most about conditions, said they prefer boot skiing to avoid ripping up the seat of their pants and in case they come upon a crevasse, they can jump over it.

			Before we got off the snow, I layed down to ice my shoulder for a bit as the snow descents always bother it.  The sloppy snow walking is very jarring on my body.

			We got back on the trail and headed for the car.  Luke, Aubery, and Erica ran out in front while Waqas, Sara, and I took our time behind them.  Waqas's feet weren't in great shape and neither were Sara's, and I was just tired.  We passed a few people on the trail, which surprised me being it was a Monday.  After an older couple stopped us to take our photo on the trail, we were back at the car.  A fresh set of clothes was a welcomed sight and we drove to the Rainier Bar and Grill in Enumclaw for some post climb food again.  Even though we didn't summit it was still a good weekend.  I didn't feel great by any means, but I felt a little better on summit day than I have in the past, and we made it the highest I have ever been on a mountain, just over 12,700'.  Sitting in the tent during our rest day on Sunday, I was done with Mount Rainier.  I didn't have any aspiration to ever come back, whether or not we'd summit the next day.  Writing this trip report almost a month later, I still don't have any desire to attempt Mount Rainier again this year, but I'm feeling a little bit more confident in my ability to tag it someday.  Unfortunately I'm in the best volcano climbing shape I'll probably ever be in right now, spending many weekends up high and hiking almost every weekend for training.  After our attempt on Mount Rainier I was just shy of 80,000' in elevation gain for the year, a lot more than any other year and I still have a lot of climbing season left.  I don't think I want to dedicate another climbing season to the volcanoes as I'm anxious to get back to rock climbing, but maybe one day we'll luck out with a beautiful weather weekend and a shot from Ingraham Flats and I'll give Rainier another try.  Until then I'm content to climb other smaller mountains, hopefully with a little rock climbing involved, and take pictures of Mount Rainier from those summits.
