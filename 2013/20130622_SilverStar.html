			<h1>Silver Star 6.22.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			Aaron, Sara, Matt and I planned to climb together for the weekend since we hadn't all been out together for a while.  Sara and I were hoping for a two day climb with some good elevation to keep up our volcano training.  It looked like we had a decent weather window on Saturday so we settled for a one day climb instead.  We narrowed the search down to Mt St Helens, Silver Star, and Sahale.  Unfortunately I couldn't get any permits for Mt St Helens so we went with my second choice, Silver Star.  After reading recent trip reports I decided I really wanted to head in and knock this off the list in a day.  It'd be just over 5000' of elevation gain for a day and I owed Sara the summit.  We went in over Labor Day in 2011, but unfortunately I had gotten sick the Tuesday before.  Against everyone's better judgment though, I didn't want to sit at home for the long holiday weekend so I still went out climbing.  Sara took most of my gear so that we could move at the glacial speed I could barely muster, but I still just didn't have enough energy on day two and turned us around at about 7700', about 1100' shy of the summit.  After the chossading we did on the way down, Sara and I said we'd only come back when it was all snow covered.

			Friday night we picked the guys up in Everett and headed out on Highway 20 to sleep that night at the Lone Fir Campground, maybe a mile from the pullout for Silver Star.  We woke up about 5:15am and were on the trail by 6:15am.  At least this year we wouldn't be heading up in the heat of the afternoon.  The most recent trip reports were from the Silver Star Creek approach and it seemed like we wouldn't hit snow until 6500', which is about where the bench is on the Burgundy Col approach.  Looking from the road though, it didn't look like there was much snow up to the col.  So much for avoiding the loose choss by heading up when everything was still snow covered.  We started picking our way through the boulders and rocks down from the road to reach the trail.  There was a small tree across the creek that Sara and Matt walked across, but Aaron and I opted for a slightly larger one just down creek a little.

			Once across the creek the up started.  Sara was out front with me behind, slowing the guys down behind me.  I wasn't feeling terrible but I wasn't feeling great either, it was a pretty low energy day for me and I felt light headed for most of the climb up.  My shoulder was also bugging me which didn't help the situation.  We took our first break so I could get some gu, hoping that'd help.

			The next break was soon after for some ibuprofen for my shoulder, and the break after that was for my heel.  Apparently I was pretty high maintenance on the hike up.  My right heel hurt, sort of felt bruised, so I took my boot off to investigate.  There was no sign of a blister and it didn't feel like a hot spot, but I still stuck some duct tape on it before we kept going up.  I think our next major break wasn't until we hit the bench at about 6500', the place we camped during our last trip.

			<p>
			We walked to our favorite sitting rocks and took a longer break to eat before heading up to the col.  Sara had convinced us all to try climbing burritos, her new favorite climbing snack.  It was pretty tasty and I managed about a quarter of it, in addition to another gu before heading up.  We had just hit the first real snow patch along the trail to camp, so Sara stashed her running shoes and put on her boots for the rest of the climb up.  Sara led out of camp and we picked up the trail to the choss.  There was a little bit of snow on the trail through the trees and right at the base of the choss, but soon we were out on the dirt and rocks trying to follow the cairns up.

			Getting above the tree line we had some great views of the north cascades to the west of us.  The morning started out with hardly a cloud in the sky, but they were slowly moving in above the mountains now.  We still had pretty good views though.  Aaron took off ahead and found a snow patch to kick steps up.  It was certainly faster heading up the snow.

			After that we picked our way across one last bench before we arrived at the Burgundy Col.  We took a little bit of a break up there to eat, get some sunscreen on, and get our snow stuff out - gaiters, ice axes, shells.  It was certainly windy at the col, and before too long I decided I needed to keep moving before I got too cold.

			During our last attempt, we had decided to downclimb the rock (skier's left) instead of heading down the icy snow from the col.  In hindsight that was a terrible idea and was probably the most terrifying downclimbing I've ever done.  We welcomed the nice snow to plunge step down and it took a minute or two instead of probably close to an hour last time to reach the bottom.  Last time we had to take turns as to not rain down the rocks we were pulling out of the wall/mud on each other.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once at the bottom, Matt and Aaron took off out front to kick steps for us.  The snow was a little soft so we didn't use our crampons.  Before long we arrived at the ridge where we had turned around last time.  This year it took us about four hours from the car to reach this spot.  Last time it took us six hours, but that was spread over two days even.  Amazing what being healthy and in a bit better shape will do.

			After shedding some layers after the cold Col, the guys continued on kicking steps for us.  We made steady progress behind them and soon came to the bottom of a couple old avy debris fields.  There were two guys that caught us at the col, Sara's friend Craig and his friend Chris.  Craig took over kicking steps as they passed us while we took a quick break.

			<p>
			Of course, as we were approaching the summit, the clouds rolled in and we couldn't see much of anything.  It was a good final push up to the base of the summit rock.  Craig and Chris took off just as we got there.  After a quick discussion we decided to drop our packs, grab the cameras and GPS units, and scramble up.

			It was a mix of scrambling with some small snow patches to kick steps through.  The crux of the scramble was a stem off a flake to reach a rather blank slab section, but a nice undercling provided some mental protection and two steps later we were just below the summit.  We could just make out the south ridgeline under the clouds but couldn't really see anything.  We swapped pictures with Craig and Chris, and after having our fill of balancing on the rocks (not a very big summit, nor many flat-ish areas) we headed back down to the saddle to finish our burritos before heading back to the car.

			We walked over to the saddle between the two summits to eat and enjoy the mountains we could see below the cloud layer.  Although you head up the Silver Star glaccier to the summit, we didn't bring glacier travel gear based on the recent trip reports stating there were no signs of any crevasses.  We didn't see any on the way up either, so we were pretty pumped for the glissade down the snow field.

			I had brought my rain pants in anticipation of just such an event.  Sara had not, and wanting to avoid wet pants for the rest of the hike down, decided to try out the rain jacket glissade diaper I had suggested.

			Craig and Chris were nice enough to leave us some nice glissade chutes to follow down.  I got up some good speed down the first chute, just shy of maxing out at 16 mph.  Sara seemed to do well with her rain jacket glissade diaper, although she did fall over once and roll before righting herself.  In an attempt to keep the jacket in place she didn't have an ice axe or trekking pole out to steady herself.

			On the next chute I managed to somehow tumble a bit myself but landed upright and hit almost 18 mph on that section.  There was one more glissade chute so Matt and I took that while Sara and Aaron traversed back over to the base of the col.

			A hundred feet or so and we were back up at Burgundy Col, and of course the clouds were starting to move out a little.  Glad that didn't happen at the top of the summit.  Aaron thinks the clouds/no views makes it a real alpine climb.  I think it can be an alpine climb even in nice weather with views, although I don’t seem to climb on many days that fit that description.

			We stowed our ice axes, helmets, and gaiters for the trip down.  Now for the fun self-controlled sliding/falling through the choss down to the bench.  I think we all slipped/fell at some point, and for every fall we probably had another five close calls.  Matt somehow perfected the method of uncontrolled sliding down turned into running back up hill to stop himself.  It backfired once as he fell in the snow and continued through the dirt and rock.

			After an hour from starting down from the col we finally reached the bench and Sara happily retrieved her shoes from the tree.  We sat for a little while - Matt took a nap while I ate a little more and tried to lay on a rock to give my shoulder a break.  It was still bothering me and I knew the steep trail down wasn't going to help.

			We started down the trail and I fell another time or two, and almost fell many more times.  I kept an eye on my GPS, willing the elevation to melt away quickly.  We reached the creek and all walked to the bigger log this time for the crossing.  The trail was a bit muddy with some down trees through this section.  We reached the final couple hundred feet to the car up the boulder/rock field - we were almost there!

			About 10 hours and 45 minutes after starting that morning from the car, we returned.  I get to add another Washington top 100 peak to my list (#24!) and check Silver Star off my to-do list (and my 'Peaks I owe Sara' list).  It was a great day climb for getting some elevation in and I got to spend time in my favorite place - the North Cascades.
