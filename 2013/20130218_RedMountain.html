			<h1>Red Mountain 2.18.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			President's day was here and Sara had the day off. Matt was taking off too, so I decided to call in sick to join them on a climb up Red Mountain, one of the two peaks in the Commonwealth Basin area I still needed to check off my list.  Matt wanted to tour while I had no interest in skiing out the trails through the basin.  I picked the comfort of my slowshoes instead.  I was surprised to see decent weather at the pass as it was suppose to be clouded in.  I snapped a few pictures of the mountains from the parking lot before the views disappeared, and then we took off a little before 8am.

			I was a bit cold so I took off in the lead, heading up the highway of trails through the basin.  This was the first time I was back since my Mount Thomson attempt in September, and I felt like I had a better understanding of the trail<span style="font-size: small;"> system</span>.

			Aaron had really wanted to head up the South Gully on Guye Peak to get in some technical climbing, so we scouted the route as we got views of it through the trees.  After a half hour we found ourselves at the log crossing, making good time.  I was aiming to follow the trail to the switchback up Kendall, continuing past the switchback and out the end of the basin to Red Mountain.

			In the meadow the trail got a little soft, as it's much less traveled, so we stopped to put snowshoes on. Matt had been up Red a few times already so he was trying to keep us on track, urging us to start heading right to hit the ridge we wanted. We decided to stick to the trail a little while longer hoping it'd cross over in the trees, allowing us to avoid breaking trail in the deep snow ourselves. Unfortunately the trail didn't cut over enough and were getting a little too high on the wrong ridge. Matt took lead and broke trail for us on his skis.  We went as quickly as possible across the open slope and the avalanche gully.  The snow had a foot of soft, powder on top of a harder crust so I was sliding around a little in my snowshoes on the traverse.  Sara somehow found a hole in the middle of the traverse and sank to her waist before climbing back onto the path.

			Once across the traverse, Matt continued breaking trail up.  Sara took over as second to try and kick in some better steps for me to follow in my snowshoes.  I really need to get a better pair.

			The clouds blew in and out of the area as we headed up, allowing us occasional glimpses of the mountains near Snoqualmie Pass.  The wind picked up so we decided to stop and throw jackets on part way up the ridge.

			Just shy of four hours, we reached the summit.  Matt was up first and found some rocks just barely poking out of the snow.  Since we know there is a summit cornice up there, we decided to stick close to the rocks.  We got one quick view of Mount Thomson before the clouds rolled in.

			After a couple quick summit photos, we started down.  We decided to find a more sheltered area from the wind to eat lunch.  Matt got ready for the ski down as Sara and I started plunge stepping down.  We made quick progress descending about 1000' while Matt got a few turns in.  The snow was pretty good for plunge stepping, with a crust about knee deep.  Most of the time I was able to just sink enough of my heel, every so often with it bouncing off the layer and sending me for a little slide.  We decided to continue down the ridge we were suppose to head up originally and pick the trail up from there.  Once we reached the basin, we put our snowshoes back on for the walk out.  We found a new snowbridge back across the creek and were soon headed out, down the trail past groups playing, enjoying the snow.  We made it back to the car about 6 hours after we started.  It was a good day out and I'm one peak closer to having checked everything in the Commonwealth Basin off my list.
