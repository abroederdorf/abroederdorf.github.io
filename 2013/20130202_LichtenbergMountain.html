			<h1>Lichtenberg Mountain 2.2.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was Sara's birthday weekend and her request was to get to the summit of something.  With new snow in the forecast, we anxiously watched the avalanche conditions to see what the weekend would bring.  After the forecast improved to moderate danger, playing in the backcountry was a go.  After scouring the maps for options along highway 2 and checking the backcountry ski books, we settled on Lichtenberg.  With all the new snow we figured we'd need flotation so why not ski somewhere.  It was also OFA cabin weekend so finding somewhere along highway 2 would give us easy access to stay at the cabin Saturday night, providing a short drive to Stevens Pass for OFA on Sunday.  It would be a weekend of skiing!  Based on who was staying at the cabin, we left Seattle in 3 cars, with a pit stop at the pass to pick up Fedya.  A bunch of the OFA crew decided on Lichtenberg as well so they were just heading out as we parked near Smithbrook Road.  There were several cars parked at the pulloff, although that road provides access to several peaks nearby Lichtenberg.

			We geared up and hit the trail on the beautifully sunny day about 9am.  We had a little over a couple miles on the snowed in road before we'd take a left and start heading up Lichtenberg.  There are two main routes up Lichtenberg from Smithbrook road.  The first leaves the road at the first switchback and heads up the drainage to Lichtenwasser Lake.  The second leaves the road at the third switchback and heads up the ridge to the lake.  From the lake you head up to the saddle and attain the summit.  This was my third backcountry ski trip, the first of the season, and I needed some time to figure out my setup.  In trying to make my boots more comfortable I loosened things too much, so I had to crank the straps back down to lock in my heel. First, however, I duct taped my heels to prevent any additional blister development.  There was a skin track leaving the road and heading into the trees so we followed accordingly.  I stayed towards the back with Aaron behind me to help me out.  He knew how much I liked my first tour with him at Yodelin a few years ago, so he was determined to make sure I had a good time this trip so I wouldn't write off touring for forever.  With my need for controlled skiing, that is a big challenge.

			Even though there was a lot of recent snow, conditions were pretty icy down in the trees.  I was having issues on some of the skin track, sliding backwards at times so Aaron would stick his poles behind my skis to give me some purchase.  One of my trekking poles needed tightening as well and kept collapsing, so Aaron traded me one of his so I could trust those more.  Kick turns are still a hilarious endeavor to watch me undertake and I had issues with those as well.  I slipped more than once on the way up, one time smacking my hand hard on the ski.  I finally started figuring out which parts would be too steep for me and started breaking my own trail in short sections.  Looking at my GPS I noticed we weren't on either of the preferred routes, rather scaling up the side of the ridge on the otherside of the drainage - great.  Steeper skin track in icy conditions with a terrible backcountry skier - let's just say I was a bundle of joy and happiness.  We got to one section that was a little too steep.  Aaron tried breaking a new trail but gave up and booted up the hill.  Unfortunately he was a ways in front of me so I had to wade through the snow to break my own trail before I could get up to the giant steps left by the others.  Eventually I made it up to the rest of the group and they took off, as we were close to the lake.

			My feet were pretty sore and I was beyond frustrated - I was ready to take a break in the sunshine at the lake while the rest of the crew headed up to the summit.  We weren't exactly sure how we wanted to go down though, only knowing we didn't want to go down the same way we came up.  We thought we'd try heading down the ridge to the third switchback.  Not quite seeing what was beyond the lake, the crew thought they may head down from over there so they wanted me to continue on.  We decided to take a lunch break and regroup a bit before we left the lake.  It being Sara's birthday weekend, Aaron had carried up a red velvet cupcake while I had some candles so we had a little celebration.

			After everyone was in better spirits I decided to continue on with the group, not knowing how much farther I'd end up going.  The snow above the lake was much better, soft powder instead of icy crud.

			We saw the other group head down and shouted to them across the way.  They suggested avoiding the summit as it was getting very soft in the sun, and we talked about options down.  It sounded like they were going to go the same way we were thinking.  After a little while longer, I decided I had enough of an adventure for the day and I'd ski back to the lake and wait for everyone there.  Aaron stopped with me while the others continued up to the ridge.  I could just see some mountains to the north - northeast of us, it was a beautiful day.  I was jealous of the views I knew I'd be missing from the ridge, but my feet and spirit were broken enough already.

			We took our skins off, grabbed our helmets, and I followed Aaron down to the lake.  The snow was pretty nice to ski in and we got several turns in as we tried to avoid holes.  Once back at the lake we skated across to the end where we'd need to go to head down.  We sat in the sun, checked the map, and waited for the crew to return.

			Before long the other four popped out of the trees and made their way across the lake towards us.  Not wanting to put skins on, we started on a lengthy side step and skating adventure to make up the small elevation from the lake before we could head down the ridge.

			The snow in the trees was pretty icy again but the crew was awesome.  They'd all head down and then point me towards the best route down for me.  I employed some awesome power wedging most of the way down, but I at least felt fairly comfortable.  We slowly navigated our way down through the trees and finally made it back to the road.

			It was slightly uphill so we took our skis off and hiked a little ways, before cresting the road and putting our skis back on.  We cut the short switchback and then were headed out on the road.  The road was a bit icy too, but thanks to the groups before us, a fairly wide track had been cleared out so I could continue employing my power wedge to slow myself down when needed.  Unfortunately the tour didn't go as well as I hoped, but I got out to enjoy a beautiful day in the mountains with friends.  I'll keep trying and hopefully one of these days I'll enjoy touring in the mountains.
