			<h1>Wallace Falls 12.29.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			Aaron’s parents only had one full day left in Seattle before heading back to the frozen tundra known as Minnesota, so we wanted to get out in the mountains one more time. The forecast wasn’t stellar but it was showing only a 12% chance of rain.  After the slippery and icy mess that was the Snow Lake trail, we tried to find something that would be snow free.  We checked WTA for recent trip reports, considering Little Si.  I saw a trip report for Wallace Falls that said the trail was in good condition and snow free, so we decided to head there.  They wanted to go sailing in the afternoon so we decided to leave about 8am to get the hike in and be back for a 3pm sailing.

			On the way out to Wallace Falls State Park in Goldbar, it started to rain.  I had forgotten to stick a light rain jacket in my minimal pack before we left. and  I certainly didn’t want to hike in my fleece and be wet and cold.  I suggested stopping for ponchos at a gas station, or an umbrella or something.  I thought I might have some ponchos in the car though, so we continued on.  If it was really raining no one wanted to go hiking, so we figured we head back and find some nice breakfast along the way.  We pulled into the parking lot at the state park and it was fairly empty.  The rain had turned to a light drizzle and I found 4 ponchos in my trunk.  Cindy and I, wanting to avoid hiking wet and cold, donned the two clear ponchos as we set off on the trail.  Aaron ran ahead as he didn’t want to be associated with me and the awesomeness that was the clear poncho.

			We did the short walk under the high voltage lines and got a cloudy glimpse of the mountains along highway 2 before we headed into the trees.  After walking through the wooden fence to keep bikes out, we hiked up the Woody trail along the Wallace River.

			It was the perfect day for a river and waterfall hike as the clouds and fog shrouded the mountain views.  The trail heads through a very green forest, lots of moss and ferns everywhere.  There are several small little falls along the river, and the trail is really well maintained.  It had sets of steps and several bridges, with no snow and minimal mud.  After a couple of the steeper uphill sections, we packed away the ponchos as the drizzle had mostly stopped.  I think Aaron claimed me again finally.

			After two miles we reached the lower falls and picnic shelter.  We took some pictures and grabbed a quick snack.

			Another quarter mile or so brought us to the main attraction of the day, the middle falls, a 265’ waterfall.  After a mini photo shoot courtesy of my tripod, we decided to head down.

			Jeff really wanted to continue up but we needed to get back and I didn’t want to push my hip flexor.  There was a lot more traffic on the trail as we started back down.  Just after the lower falls we reached the trail junction and decided to head down the Railroad Grade instead.  That trail is an old road so it was nice and wide, and void of tree routes to look out for.  There were several signs along the way, informing us about the logging industry.  We only met a couple people on that trail too, so it was a good, quiet choice for heading back to the car. We packed back up in the car after a great little morning hike, and headed for Seattle for an afternoon out on the water.
