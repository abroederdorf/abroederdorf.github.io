			<h1>Snow Lake 12.26.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			The forecast for the day after Christmas was looking pretty good.  Aaron’s parents were visiting for the holidays, and after the first couple days of their trip involving the typical Seattle rain, we were looking forward to some sunshine to get out in the mountains.  They wanted to do some snowshoeing so we decided to head out towards Snoqualmie Pass and head up to Snow Lake.  We left Seattle about 9:30am and made our way to the Alpental parking lot.  We were expecting to take the winter trail into Source Lake but the upper parking lot wasn’t even plowed yet and we saw people heading up the summer trail.  The pass is definitely hurting for snow, and it doesn’t look like the resorts will be opening any time soon unless they get several feet of snow.  
			</p>
			<p>
			We strapped our snowshoes to our packs and headed up the very icy trail.  With minimal snow and all of the boot traffic, the trail included very compacted snow, which was often slippery, and interspersed patches of ice.  It was a sunny day though, a beautiful day in the mountains.

			We had great views of the ridge above Source Lake with Chair and Bryant Peaks looming above.  There was never enough snow to use the snowshoes, but we carried them just in case.  The group made it to the trail junction.  My hip flexor has been bothering me lately so I decided to sit along the trail while they went up the ridge above Snow Lake.  I had my big puffy, sit pad, and found a nice sunny patch to sit in.
			</p>
			<p>
			It was a lot warmer in the sun than I anticipated, so it was pleasant sitting there in my puffy jacket.  I didn’t even have to use my hand warmers.  I ate some food, built a little snowman, took lots of random pictures, and threw snowballs in some of the nearby holes.  I had to pass the time somehow.

			I tried resting my head on my arms, but camp robbers kept swooping in and sitting on my trekking poles, startling me when they’d take off again.  I spent some time watching them fly around me and took some pictures.  I think they wanted Cheeri, my snowman with cheerio facial features, but I kept them at bay.

			I watched as the sun dropped below the ridgeline and then started to figure out what I wanted to do.  Without the sun it was much cooler so I’d either have to head down the trail a bit to find a sunny patch or head back to the car.  As I was just starting to get up to pack my stuff, Sara made it back down the trail and whistled at me.  I finished packing up and we decided to head back to the car.  I was taking little steps with my hip flexor so I figured I could use the extra time.

			There were several other groups on the trail as well.  One included a girl in running shoes – I’m amazed she was able to stay on her feet on the slick trail.  I slipped and slid a bit down the trail but luckily no major wipe outs.  Sara avoided falling on her head which was good.  We made it back to the jeep and enjoyed some quick snacks. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes later the rest of the group appeared as well.  We loaded up the cars and took off for Issaquah, excited for the burritos we’d soon be enjoying.  It’s sort of incredible just how low of a snow year it is.  It was interesting to get out in the mountains, away from the ski resorts, to see what the conditions were like.
