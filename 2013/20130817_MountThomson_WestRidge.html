			<h1>Mount Thomson - West Ridge 8.17 - 8.18.13</h1>
			
			<h3 class="statsTitle">West Ridge: 5.6, 5 pitches, Grade II</h3>
			<p>
			Plans were made to head into Mount Thomson for the weekend.  With the mudslides closing highway 20, the BRC graduation climbs were moved to I-90.  Aaron and Matt both volunteered to take a student, so Sara and I tagged along.  Tim and Jackie were the two lucky students assigned to climb Thomson, instead of the other one day options of the Tooth or Ingalls.  I had attempted Mount Thomson last year during September but we hit rain after the Kendall Katwalk and decided to turn around when we reached Ridge Lake.  We weren’t sure if the route would be dry the next day, and I didn’t feel like bivying in the rain.

			Mount Thomson was on my hit list, and with the long approach, I was hoping to get it ticked off on my second try.  Everyone met at our place at 9am Saturday morning and we piled into a couple of cars.  Last year we discovered the Riverbend Café in North Bend, or more specifically, their bagel breakfast sandwiches so I was looking forward to stopping there on the way.  We arrived at a very full trailhead, found the last couple spots in the upper lot, and got ready.  We left the parking lot about 11:45am.
			</p>
			<p>
			Last year I had taken the old Commonwealth Basin trail to cut some of the distance off the PCT, so we did that again this year.  The trail is easy to find just beyond the lower trailhead. We headed up the slightly overgrown trail and soon came to the log crossing.

			<p>
			A couple more stream crossings beyond that brought us to the trail junction, first with the trail to Red Mountain, and then with the PCT.  We took a right, then a left on the PCT and continued up Kendall Peak.  There were lots of berries along the trail so the crew stopped a few times to sample them.  It was cloudy but the sun would break through every so often.  We got some good views of the Commonwealth Basin as we traversed low across Kendall Peak.

			At the switchback to head back north on the high traverse, we took a break.  My shoulder was bugging me so I had already given my trekking poles to Jackie and welcomed a break from my pack.  I managed to fit everything in my 26L pack, thanks to Aaron taking the filter.  Unfortunately it isn’t the best pack for carrying 32/33 lbs, but it’s a lot smaller than the 50L for a follower pack.  After some food and chatting with climbers/hikers/backpackers on their way down, we set off on the trail.  We made steady progress across Kendall and finally had the Katwalk in sight.  This would be our high point for the day and we only had a mile or so left to camp.  We also got our first good views of Mount Thomson from here and a view of everything east of Kendall Peak.

			<p>
			We took a short break on the Katwalk.  I found an awesome rock seat to lay on to rest the shoulder from the pack again.  We started back down the trail, still mostly traversing, as Sara and Matt recounted the conditions through this section during their attempt last year – a lot less snow this time around.  We spotted Ridge Lake below us on the trail and started scoping out camp spots.  There were a lot of people on the trail, and one hiker commented that there was another group trying for Thomson that weekend as well.  We weren’t sure if he said three teams or a team of three, turns out it was a team of three.  With all the good camping taken right along Ridge Lake, we headed just west of the trail to some old campsites and set up there, still very close to the lake.

			<p>
			After picking out some spots and setting up the tents, we grabbed the new water filter and all the water bottles and went over to the lake.  Jackie had never filtered water so she took a turn pumping, as did Tim.  Armed with a lot of water, we headed back to camp to make dinner.  There were still people filtering in on the trail so we soon had camping neighbors close by.  With a potentially busy route the next day, the group decided to still stick to the original plan and leave camp by 7am. We figured there might be other groups trying for the early start too, so we might as well stick to the original plan.  It was still early in the night but with nothing left to do, and wanting to escape the bugs, we all retired to our tents.  I think I finally fell asleep a little after 8pm with my alarm set for 6:15am the next morning.
			</p>
			<p>
			The old guys camping nearby woke up a little after 5am, so hearing them coupled with the long night, meant I woke up well before my alarm.  I didn’t really want to leave the warmth of my sleeping bag but I finally got up and put my down vest and jacket on to stay warm.  Everyone slowly got up, Tim and Jackie eating some warm breakfast.  Jackie even perfected the art of Jetboil pan toasting a pop tart.  Sara geared up and wore her harness in, while I took the pack with the rope, our jackets, the water, and some food.  We left camp just a few minutes after 7am and walked in the bright morning sun along the PCT.  We found Bumblebee Pass and headed up the climbers trail.   From the pass we got our first good view of Mount Thomson and the challenges that awaited us.

			<p>
			We started down into the basin, and then up the scree.  It was mostly larger rocks/boulders to hop along for the first section, with the rocks getting smaller and more loose as we made our way up to the ridge.  We consulted the beta which included a picture from the Beckey guide and another from a recent trip report, to determine which gully to head up to reach the ridge.  Eventually we decided on the right gully and headed up past the loose rock.

			Mount Rainier and Mount Adams were soon visible over the ridge; it was turning out to be a really nice day.  We reached the ridge and Sara scrambled up another small section to where we would start climbing.  Looking down, the left gully would have gone as well and would have been shorter, with a traverse around the north (left) side to the start.

			Sara and I both brought our rock shoes so we got those on and I put my harness on.  Sara took a step left around the corner from me and started up.  The sun was creeping across the rock but unfortunately I was still in the shade which was pretty cold.  I had my down vest and some gloves on luckily.  Sara yelled off belay so I took her off and got ready to climb as she pulled the rope up.  Apparently rope drag wasn’t the best so she put me on belay with a few meters of rope left to go.  Eventually she got to me and I started up. I kept my gloves on as my hands were still pretty cold and followed up the rope.  The climbing wasn’t too difficult, although there weren’t a ton of gear placements.  It was a good warm up pitch and before too long I was at the anchor at a tree.

			<p>
			I grabbed the gear and pulled my gloves off.  I tried to warm up my hands a little and then took off up the route.  I just kept heading up, trying to take the path of least resistance.  I didn’t place a ton of gear but just enough (in my opinion).  I moved a little left and right through the sections, but managed to place all my gear straight up from the top of the first pitch so I didn’t have any rope drag to contend with.  From what I heard with the other groups, rope drag was more of any issue for them.  The pitch had a couple challenging moves and I was glad to have my rock shoes on.  The beta said to belay from a large boulder but I came to a gnarled tree on a relatively nice ledge so I slung the tree and brought Sara up.  She grabbed the gear and started off on the third pitch.  I could see Jackie just starting up the first pitch below, and a team of three approaching the route.  We figured we had enough of a head start that we shouldn’t pose a problem for them.

			I couldn’t hear Sara from the top of pitch three but eventually there was no rope left so I took off.  Sara lucked out and got all of the pitches that wandered from view so communication was more challenging; all of my pitches I could still hear and talk to her without much difficulty.  From the gnarled tree Sara went right and then up the blocky terrain.  She found an old piton just before stepping onto the slab and clipped it for fun.  The right facing slab on pitch 3 was quite large but fairly low angled with spots for a couple pieces of gear.  As soon as I reached the slab, I could see Sara belaying me from the island of trees.   I ran up the slab and anchored in for the gear exchange.

			We had a pretty good picture on our beta sheet of where pitch 4 went so I started up the blocky terrain.  There was one tricky move to pull through but I protected with a #2 and found really good hand holds.  I spotted a tree, and since they are my favorite piece of protection, I slung it.  Soon after I immediately regretted that decision as I had to traverse back right a ways and had terrible rope drag.  Luckily, the other teams made better decisions and skipped the tree.  After that I climbed up small benches until Sara yelled up to me that I had less than 10m of rope left.  I was just at the edge of the slab on the top of the false summit, and not knowing that I’d find good gear placements if I went farther, decided to set up an anchor where I was.  There happened to be several cracks there so I placed a #3 C4, a #1 mastercam, and a #6 nut.  Our beta had said gear to 3” but we debated just bringing through 2”.  Luckily Sara brought her #3 because I think we placed it on almost every pitch.  Aaron only brought through 2” and didn’t have an issue though.  Sara quickly climbed up to me and grabbed the gear to head off on pitch 5.  There was a boulder a move or two below me that Matt slung for an anchor on pitch 4, so you can get through the whole climb using natural anchors.

			Sara quickly traversed the slab on the top of the false summit and started down to the notch between it and the true summit.  She disappeared from view so I watched the rope which was quickly running out. I yelled to let her know she had less than 10m.  I didn’t hear a response so I kept belaying until there was no rope.  I waited a second and, assuming she might need me to simul climb a little bit to reach an anchor, broke down my gear anchor and stepped up onto the slab.  I walked up to the first piece of gear and waited, but the rope kept getting taken up so I assumed she had me on belay.  I pulled the couple pieces of gear she placed and then we were within sight and yelling range of each other again.  Heading down to the notch involved hiking down really loose rock.  Sara didn’t place any gear heading down to the notch, so she kept me on a very loose belay so she wouldn’t accidentally pull me off my feet.  I made it down without an issue and crossed the notch to where she had placed a couple more pieces.  I headed up the left side on the true summit, and a few moves up blocky terrain got me to the tree Sara used for the anchor.  She set up her anchor at the upper tree so that the teams behind us could use the lower.

			<p>
			I grabbed the gear and set off.  I made maybe two moves on blocky terrain above the tree and I was basically on the summit, I just had to walk a little ways to reach the true high point.  I told Sara to take me off belay and follow up.  It’s a fairly flat summit with no where to protect so the belay wasn’t going to do anything.  I made it to the high point and just pulled in the rope as Sara walked up, to keep it out of her way.  The guys had to simul a couple moves to reach the tree at the top of pitch 5 from the boulder anchor at the top of pitch 4, but it’s easy terrain on both ends. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Tim and Jackie both got the honors of ‘leading’ up the last section from the top of pitch 5 to the summit.  After everyone was safely up we grabbed a quick bite, took a couple group photos, and started down.

			The ridge to the east looked a little loose and exposed so initially Sara and I were going to stay roped up.  We did change back into our approach shoes, and just as we were about to head down, I spotted the summit register.  Sara signed everyone in, and after conferring with the guys, we unroped and followed them down.

			</center>
			<p>
			Not far below the summit was the first rappel station with plenty of slings.  The second rappel was fairly close to the bottom of the first, but to find the third we traversed skiers left and down through some trees.  There was plenty of loose rock so we had to carefully rappel down to avoid kicking them down.  There were trails along the mountainside leading down from the third rappel so I started down the loose stuff.  The trail was fairly distinct as we followed it through trees and bushes.   I kept an eye on the ridge and kept checking out the other side to make sure we weren’t missing our gully.  We kept to the trail, with a small section of downclimbing, and soon came to the descent gully.  It’s a very wide gully with a distinct trail heading down from the top of it.  We rearranged gear a bit and started down the scree slope.
			</p>
			<p>
			The scree down from the east ridge was a lot worse than what we ascended up to the west ridge. We stayed high at the base of the rock and traversed skiers right.  The terrain was a little less steep there so we chossaded down, doing the controlled slide down the slope in the scree.  Finally we made it to a bit more of a trail where the rocks were more stable, and eventually back into the grassy basin.  Most of us were out of water so we took our chances and drank a little from the running stream.  We caught up to the other team we had seen and learned they bailed from pitch 2, which is why we didn’t see them again while on route.  I was the first to start back up to Bumblebee Pass.  I was ready to get back on the PCT and away from all of the loose rock.  The hike up the pass wasn’t as bad as I expected and I was happy to soon be on the PCT. We walked back to camp and quickly packed up, after everyone got a chance to down some of the filtered water we had waiting.
			</p>
			<p>
			We left camp a little after 5pm.  With my shoulder bugging me, I decided to hurry down the trail.  I figured it if it was going to hurt, I might as well try to go faster so I had less time with my pack on.  I passed several groups on the way down, getting questions from several since I had the rope sticking out from under the cap.  After I hit the traverse back across Kendall I didn’t meet any more people and zoned out into my own world.  I found the junction back to the old Commonwealth Basin and was happy to be on the home stretch.

			I navigated the creek crossings with minimal wet-shoes and soon heard the loud roar of traffic from nearby I-90.  I finally popped back out on the PCT and was a few minutes from the car.  I made it back at 7:35pm, about 12.5 hours after leaving camp that morning.  I ditched the pack and changed clothes as I waited for the rest of the crew.  They also made good time and showed up about 20 minutes behind me.  We made a bee line for the Issaquah Brew Pub for some late dinner before heading back to Seattle.

			<strong>Gear</strong>: 60m rope, #1 mastercam, #0.3 - 3 C4s, set of nuts, 5 single and 5 double alpine draws.  Cams were more useful than the nuts, although I did place a few nuts
