            <p>
                Last New Year’s Sara and Matt built a paper mache Mount Rainier and lit it on fire to bring in 2013, the year of the volcano.  With my primary focus on climbing volcanoes, continuing my new running regime, and a shoulder injury, my normal activities changed slightly and resulted in a year of high mileage and elevation gain accomplished on my own two feet.

                My focus for the year of the volcano was preparing myself by getting out in the mountains every weekend and getting some elevation in, occasionally in less than ideal weather. I increased both my mileage and elevation gain by about 78% over last year, while my rock climbing decreased about 60%.  It was definitely an unusual balance of activities for me as I’m always itching to get out rock climbing, but it was nice to be out in the mountains and climb some new ones.

                The high chance of rain on many of our training hikes early in the year kept us closer to home, because honestly, who wants to drive a couple hours to spend all day hiking up a mountain in the rain?  I finally summited several of the peaks along I-90 as they fit our requirements of at least 3,000’ in gain and were close to home.  I was fortunate to take three trips up into the Enchantments this year.

                We went up in the spring again, in search of drier weather, and tagged Little Annapurna.  I was able to snag permits for Labor Day so we finally were able to climb Prusik, and I also finally got up there for my larch trip which I’ve wanted to do for a couple years.  Luckily the Labor Day and Larch trips were during amazing weather weekends so I finally got to see the beauty of the Enchantments first hand.

                Top 100 peaks noted
            </p>
            <p>
                I tagged 19 new summits this year, a pretty successful year overall.  In addition to getting up into the Enchantments a bunch, we got up to the North Cascades as well and knocked a few more top 100 peaks off the list.  In the fall, we took a trip down to the Tatoosh too and bagged 6 peaks that weekend, 5 of which were new for me.  I still didn’t do as many climb/hikes as I have in prior years, but I was going on a lot of multi-day trips.  I had lots of two day trips, and even a few three day trips, but I guess that goes along with trying to climb bigger mountains.

                The year of the volcano saw some successes, although not as many as I would have liked.  In the end I was able to check two volcanoes off my list, but the journey was filled with a lot of learning, gaining some confidence back in myself, lots of beautiful days in the mountains, and fun memories with old friends and some new climbing partners.  I learned that altitude starts to hit me hard between 8500’ and 9200’, but if I throw up, chances are I can keep going (mostly because Sara won’t let me turn around).  I really like a routine of short breaks on summit day so I can keep eating and drinking, and I actually have started to listen to music while on rope teams to combat the hours of silence while climbing in the dark.  I had a good go of it on Mount Hood but ended up turning around early after I threw up, 700’ shy of the top.

                We unfortunately left our snowshoes behind on our first Mount Baker attempt and were just not able to move fast enough through all of the snow – but at least I didn’t throw up!

                Mount Rainier stresses me out for at least the week leading up to the climb, but for our first attempt this year I was able to eat a whole bagel before we started! (Last year I ate about an eighth of a bagel before we started).  High winds turned us around at Camp Schurman.

                Last minute bad weather forecast for Mount Rainier at the end of June forced us to join the giant crowds on Mount Baker.  This was probably one of my favorite trips of the year for several reasons.  After a bad start of bushwhacking up, we set up camp near some friends we ran into on the Squak, and we had the place to ourselves since everyone else was on the Easton route.  The weather was amazing and I took some of my favorite pictures.  Sara led the rope team up with Luke in the middle and me bringing up the rear.  I wasn’t feeling good and threw up at the crater rim about 1000’ shy of the summit, but Sara wasn’t letting us turn around.  I think I felt a little better after that actually and we made the summit – my fourth attempt on Mount Baker and my first volcano!  I wasn’t overly excited at the time since I didn’t feel good, but it was a great confidence boost going forward to finally have one under my belt.  As much as I learned about myself, I think Sara figured out an equal number of tricks to keep my stress level down and me moving up the volcanoes.

                Our second attempt on Mount Rainier involved another beautiful weekend and record crowds as we snagged one of the last permits.  Unfortunately that meant we were back on the Emmons-Winthrop route with a long summit day.  Our rest day went fairly well but we woke up to some strong winds, and after delaying an hour, decided to head up anyways.  I normally have an agreement about how many times I have to throw up before we can head back down, so I added getting knocked over by the wind to that list.  I somehow stayed on my feet and only threw up once as we were headed up.  We hit the altitude wall though and were moving slowly so we turned back about 12,700’.

                My last volcano of the year was Mount Adams with Aaron and his family, and by far, the best I’ve ever felt on a volcano.  We slept at the trailhead at about 5400’, then again at the Lunch Counter at 9500’.  I didn’t feel sick once and even had fairly good energy on summit day heading up.  We (I) moved a lot faster than anticipated so we even summited a little early in the day, meaning our glissades down involved some very icy chutes.  The whole trip was a blast, and unbeknownst to me at the time, a great way to end my volcano season.  We didn’t get a chance to head up Mount St Helens this year but it’s high on our to-do lists.  I ended up spending 13 days and 6 nights on volcanoes this year.

                I had a pretty decent ski year in 2013.  I got out in the backcountry one day as we headed up Lichtenberg in icy conditions.  I definitely had issues skinning up the icy terrain until we reached the lake, and I survival skied (power wedged) like a champion down thanks to everyone scouting the easiest lines for me to take.  Other than that, I got up to Mount Baker several days, including a great powder weekend at a cabin.  I went up to Whistler again, my second trip but the first one where I was a somewhat capable skier.  It was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed getting to explore runs other than the couple green ones.  I helped out with Outdoors For All again so I got several days in at Stevens as well.  I'm starting to ski the occasional black run, but my happy place is on the blue groomers.  I even snowboarded for a night at Snoqualmie and successfully got off the lift a few times, made some turns, and tumbled on my head several times.

                I wish I didn’t injure myself, but if I had to do it, the year of the volcano was pretty good timing.  I was already planning to mostly be out in the mountains, getting in a lot of elevation, and spending less time at the crags until we were done with the volcanoes.   I injured my shoulder at the end of February while finishing leading a route on the roof at the gym.  As I reached across my body for the final hold, I tore my muscle.  It hurt, but in true stubborn fashion, I led a couple more routes and top roped several more that night.  The end of 2011/early 2012 I was having some knee issues and after finally going in to see the doctor and hearing ‘I can’t find anything wrong, just take ibuprofen’, I decided to try some self healing on my shoulder – meaning, some breaks from my twice a week gym climbing schedule.  I started with a week break which was difficult, and then I moved to an even more difficult 2.5 week break.  My shoulder was still bugging me so I took another 2.5 weeks off before heading back into the gym.  It still wasn’t feeling great so I took another 2 weeks off, before I ran the half marathon.  After running my half marathon and spending half of a day rock climbing in Leavenworth, I figured it was worthwhile to head to the doctor since my shoulder seemed to be getting worse.  Almost 2 months after injuring myself I was given the prognosis of bursitis and a muscle tear.  I was to do physical therapy for a month, during which I wasn’t able to rock climb or run.  Luckily the doctor OK-ed me for mountain climbing so I could continue doing that – I only did a few climbs in a sling and would often lay down in the snow to ice my shoulder during the climbs.

                Last year, as I was going through my stats for climbing, someone asked about gym climbing so this year I decided to track that as well.  It was an interesting year to start tracking because I could see what I was climbing before the injury, and then how that changed after.  I assigned values for the rated difficulties of the routes, so I can get an idea of how hard I am climbing.

            <p>
                When I was given the go-ahead to start climbing again, I had to rethink the habits I had formed pre-injury which included a schedule of a short run Monday followed by climbing in the gym; long run Tuesday; climbing in the gym on Wednesday; medium run on Thursday; and then playing in the mountains over the weekend.  I decided to only do one activity a day, which probably sounds like a normal thing, but was really hard initially to regulate myself by.  I also cut back on my climbing and limited it to 5 routes a night, starting with nothing harder than a 5.9.

            <p>
                My physical therapist suggested sticking with that for a couple weeks, and if my shoulder seemed ok, I could either increase the difficulty or the quantity.  Since the gym doesn’t have a ton of easy climbs I decided to work on increasing the difficulty while sticking to the 5 climb rule.  I’m back up to climbing 5.10c’s, although I limit how many overhung routes I do, and I’m just starting to do 6 climbs a night.  I’ll be interested to see how my climbing changes in the new year.  I’m not pain free, but I can belay now without it hurting much and I’m starting to build up my strength again.
            </p>
            <p>
                My reduction in gym climbing translated to less climbing outdoors too.  I tried to maintain my gym climbing rules outside, so nothing harder than a 5.9 and no more than 5 or so climbs in a day.  Luckily a lot of the alpine climbs I wanted to do were 5.6 or 5.7, so I got some big ones checked off my list like Mount Thomson and Prusik Peak.

                Not being able to climb much meant I wasn’t doing much cragging.  We did climb a few days here and there in Leavenworth, and we had our yearly trip to Tieton for the rafting weekend.  I helped with Outdoors for All at Exit 38 again, but other than that, I didn’t get out cragging.  Surprisingly, I didn’t go to Vantage once this year.  Thanks to Ben and Chris’s wedding up at Whistler, I did get a couple days of cragging in up in Canada, which were some of my first outside leads for the year so I could sort of get back in the mental game before a few alpine climbs.

                Since I wasn’t doing much cragging, a lot of the climbing I did was swapping leads on alpine routes or other multi-pitch routes.  In addition to the alpine climbs, I was happy to finally finish the Tree and Stump route link-up, and do some more climbing in the Tumwater Canyon area.

                I started 2013 strong in terms of running, doing a 10 miler Jan 1.  I had the Wenatchee half marathon in April so I was maintaining a weekly average of 14 miles, which I started increasing in early February in anticipation of my race.  Unfortunately I didn’t feel good the day of my race so my result wasn’t as good as I had hoped, but I did meet my goal of running under 2:15, and better yet, with just faster than a 10 min/mile pace.  After the half I took a month off for my shoulder injury.  With all of the steep hiking my achilles was bothering me when I tried running again in June, so I took another month off.  I had signed up for the Tough Mudder in Oct, but more importantly, the Seattle Half Marathon Dec 1, so I had to start running again.  In August I started mostly from scratch, keeping to three runs a week and trying to slowly increase my mileage.  Sara signed up for the Snohomish Half at the end of Oct so I accelerated my training plan to run with her.

                We did one more training half marathon as well around Seattle, the Unofficial Seattle Waterways Half Marathon as I called it, before the Seattle half.  I didn’t feel as prepared as I did for the Wenatchee half, and given the difficulty of the course (it was a lot more hilly than any of my other races) I didn’t have any goals for myself.  I just wanted to go out and try to enjoy the run.  The Seattle half would be my first big race too with several thousand other participants.  Lina ran with me and I did better than expected, getting a new PR of 2:07:38 - a couple minutes faster than my Wenatchee race.

                Even though I had to take some time off for injuries, I still ended up running more this year than last year.  I also ran a little faster with longer average runs and more average elevation gain.  I ended up running five half marathons, two as training runs and three races.  The Tough Mudder was an interesting experience, and the Mustache Dache was a lot of fun.

            <p>
                2014 is going to be my year of rock climbing.  Aaron and I are planning to take a three week rock climbing road trip in the summer, so we’ll be spending the months leading up to it in the gym and on the rock.  My mileage and elevation gain will decrease as my focus won’t be on climbing mountains or running, but I’m looking forward to getting back out on the rock this year and hopefully seeing some improvements there.  Here’s to a year hopefully filled with lots of sunny days, dry rock, and car camping!
