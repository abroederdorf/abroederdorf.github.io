			<h1>Mount Washington 3.2.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			The weekend weather forecast looked a little dismal.  As the week progressed toward the weekend, the chance of rain turned to rain after 4pm, turned to rain after 10am with high temperatures in the mid to upper 40's - it was going to be wet.  Sunday showed cooler weather with snow but winds 15 - 20 mph.  Giving up on the hope of a nice weekend weather for one of our bigger climbing objectives, I decided I wanted to at least get out and get some elevation in to help prepare for the upcoming climbing season.  Sara was in too, so we looked for something close on I-90.  Figuring we'd be hiking in the rain, we wanted something straightforward with at least 3000' in elevation gain to get out of the rain as quick as possible.  Mount Teneriffe, Green Mountain, Dirty Harry, and Mount Washington were all offered up as options.  Looking at recent trip reports, Teneriffe and Washington looked like they had seen some traffic so we figured there would be steps all the way up.  I had hiked up to the 'viewpoint' (small clearing in the trees) on Mount Washington a few years back, but had never actually summitted.  We settled on that and left Seattle at a leisurely 7am Saturday morning.

			We geared up in the Olallie State Park parking lot and were on the trail a few minutes before 8am.  I had looked at my track from my last hike up a few years prior and remembered we had a few issues finding the trail.  This time Sara and I almost got it right, once again getting tricked by the climbers trail I forgot about.  It's about 100 feet east before the actual trail and we started up it again, soon realizing our mistake.  Instead of heading back down and to the actual trail, I wanted to continue up.  I had done that last time and we intercepted the trail, which Sara agreed would happen again looking at the topo map on her GPS. After bushwhacking up a bit we popped out on the trail and continued on.

			The trail was snow free and very rocky as we made decent time.  About 1900' we stopped so I could get some food as I was feeling a bit light headed, and then we continued on.  It was very wet out there with water pouring down many of the large rock faces.  The streams were running well too.

			We started seeing little patches of snow, and were soon on a boot packed layer as we approached the viewpoint at 2800'.  We paused for a quick look out at the cloud layer hovering over the summits of the nearby peaks before continuing on.

			The snow was more solid but there was still a good boot pack so we continued following that.  Soon after passing the trail junction with the Great Wall Trail, we came to another split in tracks.  Instead of heading uphill we continued straight ahead along the well worn path and soon came upon the large stream crossing.

			The snow was pretty deep but with a fairly good trail so we continued along and soon found ourselves on an open slope with some views of the mountains across I-90.

			As the snow got a little softer Sara decided we should stop and put out snowshoes on at about 3200'.  It worked out because I needed another quick food break as well.  I grabbed my jacket as it was cooling down as we went higher, and we started off again, finally encountering our first groups of people.  We continued plodding along at a decent pace and were within 500' of the summit with a nice view of the I-90 corridor.

			Sara kept leading up and we soon reached what we assumed was the summit with a little weather station.

			Looking at the waypoint I had put in my GPS, and Sara looking at the topo map, we thought the real summit was still possibly a short traverse away.  I started off through the snow, weaving a path through the wet trees until we popped out in a little clearing.  Thinking the other point we could see through the trees was still a little higher, we figured between the two we should have tagged the actual summit.  We ate lunch in the little clearing before heading back down.  We passed a few more groups on the way down and kept our snowshoes on until we hit the big stream crossing.  After that we made good time, soon finding ourselves back on the dirt trail.

			About 5.5 hours after we left the car we were back, and we had surprisingly beaten the rain.  We tagged the summit, didn't get rained on, and got some elevation in - overall a decent training hike.  Now hopefully the weather starts aligning in our favor so we can get our first volcanoes checked off our list - here's looking at Mt St Helens and Mt Hood hopefully in the near future!
