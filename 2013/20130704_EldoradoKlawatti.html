			<h1>Eldorado & Klawatti 7.4 - 7.6.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			For the long Fourth of July holiday weekend, extended thanks in part to a vacation day on Friday, we decided to head into the mountains and tag some peaks.  Initially Aaron had mentioned Eldorado, Dorado Needle, and Klawatti.  The night I got back from our Mount Baker climb, he and Matt decided that five peaks over four days sounded more fun and added Austera and Primus to the hit list.  I mean it’s always a good idea to take on such an endeavor when I still had some numb toes and a really tight/sore right calf from climbing a volcano four days earlier, right?  Four days worth of camping gear (namely food and socks), glacier gear, and a small rack for rock climbing meant we’d be carrying some heavy packs.  Estimating them to be between 40 – 45 lbs, assuming the guys would take the ropes and racks, Sara and I started providing some realism for their ambitious four peaks in five days plan.  Aaron was hoping to make it to the Klawatti zone for camping, making it easier to get permits and providing a good central location for the five peaks.  The traverse from there to Austera and Primius would still be a really long day.  I wasn’t so sure of my chances of making it up 6000’+ over 8ish miles with 45 lbs on my back.  I thought camping near Eldorado would greatly increase my chances of success, so we agreed to tackle three peaks in four days and stick to the original hit list of Eldorado, Dorado Needle, and Klawatti.  If we could finish in three days and head down early, all the better.  Aaron and Matt took off Wednesday to get permits, assuming they’d be hard to come by for the holiday weekend.  They took all the technical gear, allowing us to split the rest of the group gear among the four of us.  I packed food for four days, socks for four days (I hate wet feet), and luckily with the Direkt 2, my pack weighed in at about 38lbs.  Much better than I originally feared.
			</p>
			<p>
			I picked Sara up at 4:30am Thursday morning to head out and meet the guys at the trailhead.  They had camped just up the road the night before after getting our permits for the Eldorado zone.  The Eldorado Zone meant we just had to make it to the base of the east ridge on Eldorado, and we’d have a solar toilet nearby for the extended trip into the mountains.  We got to the trailhead about 7am, a little earlier than expected so we had to wait for the guys to pack up camp and get ready.  A little after 8am we were headed down the road to the log crossing to reach the trailhead.

			<p>
			This was the longest log crossing I’ve ever seen, involving multiple, really large trees to get across not only the river, but side streams and some wetland area.  It was nice and stable so no worries about plopping in the water.  We easily found the trailhead and started up the ‘efficient’ climber’s trail, i.e. one of the steepest trails you’ve ever seen.

				<span class="caption">’Efficient’ climbers trail for about 1800’ up</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			To be conservative, we estimated it taking us about 10 hours to reach camp, just a little faster than 500’ an hour assuming we’d be taking lots of breaks.  We made slow, steady progress and actually did a little better than anticipated.  A couple breaks in the trees for the first couple thousand feet in elevation brought us to the dreaded boulder field at about 4000’.

			Before emerging from the trees, we stopped to put on some sunscreen and grab a bite to eat. The only good thing about the boulder field is that we got our first views of the surrounding mountains, namely Johannesburg.

			</center>
			<p>
			Our steady upwards progress slowed as we scrambled up the boulder field, trying to follow the cairns.  We missed it at first, but there was a climbers trail heading up the right side (climbers right) of the boulder field.  When we found it, we’d take it.  Overall the navigation through the boulder field was pretty easy, although I’m sure we didn’t always take the most efficient route.  Heading up through the second boulder field the climbers trail heads up the left side so we stuck to that for most of the way.  It was rather hot out, and with the waterfalls and streams nearby, we took a break near the top of the boulder fields to grab some food and filter water.  Luckily Matt had decided to bring his filter, a good choice throughout the trip.

			<p>
			We hit solid snow about 5500’ and Matt took off, kicking steps for us over to the ridge.  We gained the ridge about 6100’ and grabbed our gaiters and some extra layers.  This would be our last break before the final push up to the ridge and camp.  After scouting a couple routes down from the ridge we settled on descending some slabby rock.  It was a little precarious but we made it and were soon headed up.

			The Eldorado Glacier was suppose to start about 6900’, but hugging the climber’s right side we felt safe enough about avoiding any crevasses that we stayed unroped.  We gained the ridge and entered the cloud that was covering the ridge and camp area.  There was one tent set up on the ridge, very exposed to the wind.  We decided to stay unroped and walk over to the rocks near the solar toilet and set up camp there.

			There was only one group on the rocks when we arrived so we found a couple of open rock walls and set up the tents – no snow camping for us!  The pair of other climbers told us where they found a stream of water, so Aaron and Sara headed down to the base of the rocks to filter water while Matt and I hung out at camp/I napped.

			After about 45 minutes Aaron woke me up for dinner.  The group decided to wake up at 5am the next morning to get going by 6am and head to Klawatti first.  I enjoyed my first chicken and rice meal of the weekend.  Bedtime was dictated by Aaron’s feet getting cold (I had brought my down booties) so we settled in to sleep about 7:45pm.
			</p>
			<p>
			We woke up at 5am to get going, and surprisingly found ourselves in a very wet tent.  Apparently the Direkt 2 doesn’t do well when it’s sitting in a cloud, despite the fact we had a large portion of the door open.  I’ve never experienced that issue with the tent before but I have always been in it on a volcano above 9000’.  I unknowingly lost the not it game and got to lead the team across to Klawatti.  The snow was a little frozen so we put crampons on and roped up.  Unfortunately we were still socked in the clouds, so for navigation I followed the boot pack and the checked the topo on my GPS while staying high near the ridge.  We had one good crevasse crossing, one that I thought was a little too wide to step across so I crossed it in a new spot.  After that, we had a couple small cracks but nothing too concerning.  Staying high on the ridge meant we gained a little more elevation than we needed, but it also kept us above most of the crevasses.

			<p>
			By about 7am the snow was softening up, but we kept the crampons on until we hit Klawatti.  There were a couple of tents set up at the base of the southwest ridge, so we tried to quietly get ready not knowing if there were sleeping climbers inside (I think they were off tagging Austera and Primus at the time).

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Base of the southwest ridge on Klawatti.  We’d head up the left side to gain the ridge</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We grabbed the rock gear, a little food and water, and left our packs at the base.  We went to the climbers left side of the ridge to find a way up to the ridge proper.  From out beta, we expected a low fifth class pitch to reach the ridge, than fourth to third to second class scrambling to the top.  Matt started up first, with Sara in tow and Aaron close behind her.  
			</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara belaying Matt up to the ridge</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			It was still clouded in and a bit cool so I climbed in my big puffy, rain jacket, and thin gloves.  They ended the first pitch at the tat on route, where we would later rappel down to the snow.  Aaron talked me into leading up next.  Since I hurt my shoulder in February, I’ve done two pitches on rock back in April – one was following and the other was a short sport lead.  I recently have started climbing in the gym again but no more than five climbs a night and generally 5.9 or under.  With not having done much rock climbing, nor placed any gear since last year, I was a little apprehensive (did I mention we were also climbing in boots) but I decided to go for it and started working my way up the ridge.  The climbing itself was easy, the most difficult part was finding rock that wouldn’t detach from the ridge and finding places for gear.  Aaron and I simul climbed up most of it, setting up an anchor once to get gear back from him.  I had the #0.5, 0.75, 1, and 2 BD C4 Camelots with a set of nuts, 5 doubles, and 4 singles.  
			</p>
			<p>
			About 30 feet higher Sara and Matt had also set up an anchor to swap leads, but after going a bit farther Sara figured the rope unnecessary so they left it and waited for us to catch up.  We left our rope with theirs and continued up the last couple hundred feet to the top over very loose rock.

			<p>
			We were still in a cloud heading to the top when we heard what sounded like a very large avalanche.  Good thing we were up on the ridge!  Later we’d find out it was part of a serac that collapsed below our traverse over that morning.  We reached the top, took some summit pictures, and started back down the loose rock.

			<p>
			I led the downclimb, finding it even more difficult to find gear placements on the way down.  We made it back to the rock with a new looking cordelette and rap ring so we set up there to rappel back to the snow.  We rappelled down the other side of the ridge than what we had climbed up to reach the snow and walk back to our packs for a food and sunscreen break.  Of course, as we were starting to head down, the clouds started lifting finally to provide us some views.

			<p>
			I volunteered to lead back over to the pass to reach Dorado Needle.  I figured being the slowest one I might as well be out front setting the pace.  We followed our steps back and soon hit the pass.  Sizing up what was involved in climbing Dorado Needle, we estimated it’d take us 8-9 hours to get back to camp, and considering it was already after noon, that would mean we’d be heading back in the dark.  Also thinking there might be some snow on route still, we decided to skip Dorado Needle and head up Eldorado instead.

			<p>
			Everyone was also in favor of a three day trip so we settled for two peaks that day and heading home in the morning.  Matt took over leading us back over to Eldorado.  We took a lower traverse back over to avoid some unnecessary elevation gain and the big crevasse crossing from the morning.  We dropped our packs when we reached the ridge and started up.  Matt grabbed one picket in case he felt so inclined to use it, otherwise we just had ice axes, water, cameras, and GPS.

			<p>
			There was a pretty defined boot pack heading up Eldorado, unfortunately a lot of the steps were down steps so Matt kicked new ones to get in his own rhythm as he led us up.  There were a couple crevasses down low that we kept to the side of near the ridge.  Before long we were on the knife edge and at the summit.

			The steps up the knife edge were a little on the icy side without a very deep trench.  It’s always easier to climb up than down anyways, so I took my time to make sure I had a solid step each time.  Before long everyone was down off the knife edge and we had great plunge stepping back down the ridge to our packs.  It took maybe an hour and a half to get back to our packs from when we left them, and another ten minutes to get to camp.  The clouds in the area were dumping over the ridgeline of Forbidden and dissipating before they hit Moraine Lake, it was quite the sight.  It seemed like another cloud wanted to wash over Eldorado and down on us like the day before, but it stayed just far enough back that we got some sun, a welcomed sight for hanging out at camp and drying some of our gear.

			A couple rangers got to camp not long after us.  We chatted for a while before they checked our permit and then went to stir the toilet.  We told them we had permits for three nights but that we were planning to head out a day early, so they could radio back and open the spots.  I sported the classic shorts, down booties, and puffy look as I let my boots, gaiters, and the bottoms of my pants dry out.  After snacking a bit, Sara and Aaron graciously took night two of filtering water duty as Matt chatted with the rangers and I reattached my pant leg bottoms to get a little warmer.  I had night two of chicken and rice before heading to bed about 8pm.  Our plan was to wake up whenever the next morning and head out to the car.  Being the most tired and a really good sleeper, I was last up just before 7am the next morning.  There were still clouds around but it was more clear and we had some sunshine.

			I was especially hungry so after eating a bunch of food (none of us wanted to carry extra weight down anyways) we packed up camp and left the rocks about 9am.  We didn’t plan on roping up on the way down (thank goodness because my hips were nice and bruised) so we started back along the tracks to the ridge, and proceeded to glissade down to the crossover to the ridge.  We passed one group of four coming up the glacier.  We found a better gully to gain the ridge this time, and continued glissading down the snowfield on the other side.

			We stopped at the same place along the stream as on the way up, to eat a little and put away our snow gear.  We knew we had about 1500’ of boulder field awaiting us.  We started down, determined to use more of the climbers trail now that we knew where they were.  We passed another group of four heading up the boulder field.  We were kind of surprised there weren’t more groups up there when we were given it was a holiday weekend, but I guess more people didn’t want to take Friday off so the crowds were coming up on Saturday.  We slowly made our way back down the boulder field, following the trail and cairns.  Finally we got back to the trees and took another break, thankful to be out of the sun.  Sara’s feet were got chewed up during the boulder field so she duct taped while the rest of us relaxed a bit.  Another group of four passed us as we were stopped, so we chatted about conditions quick before heading our separate ways.  We had just under 2000’ of steep trail back to the car, bbq, and ice cream.  Apparently I didn’t get to do enough glissading on the snow and decided to try it on the dirt trail as I slipped.  I have a really awesome elbow bruise to show for it.  We passed two guys headed in for a 9 day trip – man were their packs huge!  Glad I didn’t have to carry that up.  We were excited to note familiar landmarks and were soon back at the log crossing – almost done!  It took us about 4.5 hours to get down from camp, better than we expected.

			The mosquitos were pretty bad at the cars so we quickly packed up and headed into town.  Aaron and Matt had eaten at the BBQ train Wed night and thought that’d be a great post climb meal.  They have a bunch of tables outside so we picked one in the shade and enjoyed some BBQ.  Sara’s goal for the weekend was to get ice cream at Cascadia Farms on the way home (they close at 8pm) so we had plenty of time to do that too. It was a fun weekend in the mountains.  We tagged another two Washington top 100 peaks and still had time to see Despicable Me 2 and relax for a day.
