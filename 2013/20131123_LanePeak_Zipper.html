			<h1>Lane Peak - Zipper 11.23.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			The weekend forecast was showing sun and I actually had the days off to go play.  The trend throughout the week was warm temperatures during the day and freezing temperatures at night, so Aaron figured the Zipper on Lane Peak might have some good snow/ice for climbing.  He rounded up six of us total, for three teams of two, and checked the Mount Rainier twitter account which stated they expected the gate at Longmire to open at 9am.  Sunshine and sleeping in, the weekend was looking pretty good.  We left Seattle just a few minutes before 7am, stopped in Puyallup for some breakfast, and made it to the open gate just a little after 9am.  We parked at Narada Falls and got ready among a couple other cars of climbers as well.  We figured with the weather pattern, the snow should be pretty consolidated and with the short approach, we didn't bring any flotation. Aaron started up the hill above Narada Falls first, with the rest of us bushwhacking to follow.  The rocks were just barely covered in some spots.  I managed to make it up to the Stevens Canyon road with only banging my knee on rocks once.

			The road had some large bare patches along with some icy patches, but after a short hike, we dropped off the road and down through the trees.  We didn't see any other steps as we made our way down to the basin.  The snow was pretty firm and I was mostly able to walk across the top.

			We found a good downed tree to cross the larger stream.  Half of the group was on the tall side so they jumped across the little stream while I did a little exploring to find a narrow section better suited for my leg length.  Just a little traversing past that brought us to the base of Lane Peak and we headed up to the start of the Zipper.

			The slope had slid recently so we climbed an icy snow like boulder field through the slide alder.  Some of the icy chunks were getting dislodged and bounding down the slope towards me, bringing up the rear, so I stopped to put my helmet on.  It was a gorgeous day with Mount Rainier looming behind us as we made our way up.

			Finally I reached the rest of the group.  Aaron and Colin were mostly geared up so Colin started off leading.  Sara and I were ready next so I started off, with Luke and Aubrey right behind Sara.

			Maybe 30 feet up into the gully we hit the first ice step.  This was my first climb in a while, and definitely my first steep snow and ice climb in quite some time, so I hadn't quite found my rhythm again and the ice step was a bit unnerving. Aaron said Colin had placed a picket below it, so I crossed over just below the ice and shoved a picket in the snow.

			<p>
			There was a fairly vertical section but I sunk some good tool placements and worked my way up past it with Sara's encouragement from below.  Just a little farther up the gully, someone had left a sling around a rock horn that I clipped. There was another thin ice step so I placed a nut, and then realized there was better snow that went up alongside the ice and followed the steps up.  Before Sara got past that part, I placed one more picket, then we simul-climbed, without any protection placed, to reach Aaron at his piton anchor just below the large chock stone and the crux of the route.
			</p>
			<p>
			Aaron had brought a few pitons along so he pounded a couple in to make a solid anchor. The chock stone had some thin ice next to it, which Colin had already led by time I reached the anchor.  Aaron offered to trail our rope so we could get belayed up the ice, which sounded great to me.  Sara untied from one of the ends, as I was tied into the middle of our half rope, and Aaron took it with him as he climbed the ice.  He then belayed me up.

			<p>
			The ice was thin but I found some good tool placements.  For the final moves onto the snow slope above, I worked my tools up as high as I could get, then I swung my legs out left until I could pull myself up to reach the snow with my feet.  A couple more steps on the easy snow brought me to the anchor, a couple of pickets.  Colin took off to finish leading the route with Aaron, while I belayed Sara up through the step.  She trailed the rope for Aubrey, who then brought Luke up trailing the rope from the father and son behind us.  It was a fun ice step, but probably more fun since I didn't have to worry about leading it.

			Above the ice step was smooth sailing up the firm snow.  Sara took over leading and I enjoyed following.  She didn't place anything so it's not like I was on top rope, but it was a nice mental break being the follower on the rope.  We made good time up the steps left for us, and soon Sara was at the top of the gully.  As I approached the final few feet, I found the piece Sara had left for me.  When we climbed Tree route a while back, I had slung a bush as mental protection, knowing it wouldn't really stop a fall but wanting something before crossing into the corner.  It's been a long time joke so with Aaron's encouragement, Sara slung a tiny little branch for me.

			After we all topped out on the gully, Aaron and Luke headed down so that Luke could get up to Paradise and skin up to the Muir hut.  The rest of us traversed a bit to reach the gully to the top.  The snow was a lot softer as it had been in the sun, but we followed some steps up.  Heading up the gully, the snow was pretty thin over the rock and being third in line, many times I had no snow left so we did some mixed climbing in our crampons.

			We reached the top and got our harnesses back out.  Luckily Colin and I had both brought our ropes so we could do a double rope rappel back down the gully from the tree at the top, already equipped with slings and rap rings.  It was just a little before 3pm and the gate was to close at 5pm, so we didn't spend much time at the top before heading back down as we knew we had a ways to go still.  Rappelling the gully was a lot quicker than trying to downclimb.  The father and son pair followed us down the ropes as well.  We packed up and started down the slope, soon picking up Aaron and Luke's steps down the gully to the basin.

			The final gully with the little stream was interesting with some thin snow as well.  We took the skier's left gully and kept our crampons on.  After some interesting steps on ice and rocks to get down, we were making our way through the devil's club and slide alder to reach the basin. It was a little before 4pm so we took our crampons off and started for the car.  It took some effort to keep moving on the final few hundred feet up to the road, but I figured Aaron would be getting worried about making it out by 5pm.  I made it up to the road about 4:30pm, and found an amazing sunset casting a glow across Mount Rainier and lighting up the sky to the west.

			We picked our way back down the snow and rocks on the hillside above Narada Falls, jumped in the car, and made it past the gate at Longmire a few minutes after 5PM.  We stopped at Longmire to change and relax a little post climb before driving home.  After a stop at Bruno's in Eatonville for some post climb food, we were on our way home.  It was a gorgeous day in the mountains and a fun, early season climb swinging my tools.
