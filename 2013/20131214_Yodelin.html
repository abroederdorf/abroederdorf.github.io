			<h1>Yodelin BC Ski 12.14.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			Saturday was looking pretty decent with no precipitation predicted until 4pm, so Aaron wanted to get out in the mountains.  I didn't want to head to Stevens Pass since I was going to be there on Sunday for training, so he suggested touring at Yodelin.  I had gone there on my first backcountry ski trip a couple years back and didn't have fond memories, but I apparently blanked those out when I said yes.  In retrospect I should have stayed in my warm bed Saturday morning and slept in, but instead I was riding in the Jeep with Aaron, Justin, and Luke by 7am to head to Yodelin.  We stopped at Starbucks in Monroe for some breakfast where I found a cheese pretzel and peppermint brownie cake pop - breakfast of champions.  We arrived at Yodelin a little after 9am and got geared up.  I was using the new skis, skins, and bindings Aaron had gotten me.

			He cut my skins Friday night, along with another pair of new skins he got for his other pair of BD Justices.  Those skins didn't come with the little divider and carry bag though, so he improvised with some wax paper and an old stuff sack.  Turns out that while fresh baked cookies don't stick to wax paper, the glue on the skins sticks very well.

			After laughing a bit and watching Aaron and Justin try to peel off all of the wax paper, Luke and I helped as well.  Finally we were geared up, and after getting a how-to on using Dynafit bindings for the first time, I started up the road.  There were a few groups that started out before us so we had a nice skin track to follow for most of the time.

			Luke was out front with Justin, and Aaron stayed back with me.  I thought I was doing fairly well, but as Luke made a new track traversing through the trees, I was faced with some challenging terrain for my far inferior skinning skills.  I still have a hard time flexing my ski sometimes, to get the area under my boot to contact the snow when the slope isn't even.  I'm not sure how to get around that, but luckily Aaron helps out by sticking his pole behind my ski so I don't slide backwards.

			There was a super tricky kick turn for me that I almost fell down the hillside during.  Luckily Aaron caught me and we finally figured out a way for me to get started back up.  I also face planted a few times in the trees for I have no idea what reason.  Needless to say although as we started I felt like I had a better handle on skinning, by the time Aaron suggested stopping at the saddle for lunch, I was ready for a break.  The day was actually pretty awesome.  We even had a period of sunshine with some blue skies.  The area truly looked like a winter wonderland.  We passed several small trees, some that looked like great candidates for a Christmas Tree.  Maybe next time Aaron and I will have to hike up there and find something to cut down.

			After a little lunch, the guys took off for a lap up Welldiggers Ass.  I didn't think I'd want to ski any extra than required so I grabbed my new shovel and dug a little throne nook in the snow to stay out of the wind while I napped.  Luke left his sit pad and Aaron left his puffy so I was able to say fairly warm with those and my hand warmers.  The guys made it back to the saddle and were convinced heading up to the summit was the best way down, rather than skiing down from the saddle through the dense trees.  I packed up my stuff and got back on my skis.  Right at that time there were three or four groups that made their way across the saddle.  We skinned up to the top of Welldiggers Ass, my first time to the summit, and I took my skins off to ski my new skis for the first time.

			When I'm in the backcountry I go into survival mode - cue the power wedge and side slipping.  The trees did have quite a bit of space inbetween, but there were a lot of trees down across the slope that created some big drop offs so Aaron helped me pick my way down the slope, traversing back and forth.  My skiing looked terrible but I had to get down some way that I felt sort of comfortable with.  
			</p>
			<p>
			We made it back to the road and we decided to head down that for a little bit while Luke and Justin cut down through the trees.  Aaron thought we'd all meet back up just a little lower, in the flat area.  I loved skiing on the road - it was wide, mostly void of trees, a very gentle slope, and I felt super comfortable.  In attempt to let me ski what I liked, we stuck to the road longer than we should have.  Finally I checked the GPS and saw we were a ways from our tracks from the morning.  Aaron gave me the option of staying behind me to help me skin, or breaking trail.  I told him to break trail and soon he had disappeared through the slide alder as I tried to follow.

			Without question, it was a very interesting skin traverse back that included stream crossings, stepping over multiple trees (tricky in skis with a free heel), and lots of steep little uphills.  The dense slide alder was terrible, but I did pull on a lot of trees in the tricky spots so they ended up being useful.  Aaron could hear Luke yelling to us but Luke didn't hear Aaron responding.  We found the meadow finally, and the skin tracks, and started down.

			<p>
			We made it to the old lift tower, and soon after that we found Luke and Justin.  Since Luke couldn't hear Aaron, he had started back up to find us since it took us a lot longer than we expected.  We had found the skin track down but still had some difficulty ahead of us.

			Unfortunately it was a little too early season and the road was overgrown with trees.  We all had our skins on our skis and I tried my best power wedge, but I still got tripped up by a few trees and fell a couple times.  My frustration level was high and I really just wanted to be back at the car.  Finally we rounded the last corner and had a fairly open slope down to the upper parking lot.  I was so glad to be done with the day, get my warm clothes, and enjoy my cake pop.  I need to start picking tours with less trees and better snow levels.  At least the day was fairly nice, but I'm not rushing out to the backcountry any time soon, I'll be content with some days at the resort.
