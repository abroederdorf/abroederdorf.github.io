			<h1>2013 Races: Snohomish River Run Half Marathon, Seattle Waterways Unofficial Half Marathon, Mustache Dache 5K, & Seattle Half Marathon 10.27 - 12.1.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			As climbing season was winding down in October, my running season picked up.  After the Tough Mudder in early October, I had the Snohomish River Run Half Marathon at the end of the month.  Sara had signed up, and after checking that she didn’t mind if I tagged along, I signed up as well.  After my shoulder issues and some time off for what I think was an aggravated achilles from all of the climbing we had been doing, I finally started running again in August.  Considering I hadn’t been able to run with any regularity since my last half marathon in April, I decided I should train from scratch.  Luckily, this time, I didn’t have to go through the first week of soreness and was able to jump right in.  I had set up my training plan with the Seattle Amica Half Marathon in mind which was the first of December, so I had to speed things up a bit for running at the end of October.  Sara planned out the long runs she wanted to do in training so I modified my own schedule with those, and then planned some longer runs between the two halves.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sara, Matt, Aaron, Danielle, and Chris all signed up for the half, and Melissa volunteered to help.  The course heads out and back on a road, and then on the trail along the Snohomish River.  One of the most appealing features of the course was the minimal elevation gain.  We parked at Cascade High School in Everett and huddled under the eave of the school to get out of the rain as we waited for the over packed shuttle bus.  We arrived at the park just a little before start time and luckily found Chris and Melissa who got to park there.  We left our bags in their car to avoid the ridiculously long gear check line and huddled at the start line.  It wasn’t too cold so I had a thin long sleeve shirt, one that I could pull my hands in my sleeves, and I wore my hat for the rain.  It had stopped raining when we started, but it misted/rained off and on throughout the race.
			</p>
			<p>
			I generally don’t like out and backs.  Most of my running routes are loops, but the out and back in the race was fun because then we got to see everyone else during it.  The road was super flat as we passed cows and trains.  There wasn’t much of a view since it was overcast.  They had three aid stations I believe along that first out and back on the road. We turned around at about 4.5 – 5 miles in.  Unfortunately on the way back they had run out of cups at the aid stations so we couldn’t get any water – I was not very happy.  We passed the start area and rounded the corner to the trail for another out and back for the last couple of miles.  This one seemed to take forever and I was kind of cold, with my hands wrapped in my sleeves.  Again, as we passed the final aid station they didn’t have any cups for water so we sucked it up and headed for the finish line.  The others were cheering us on down the final chute as we crossed the finish line with a heel kick.  I don’t think Sara quite made the goal she had in mind, but she did get a new PR, beating our Leavenworth Half Marathon time by 4 minutes.  When I finished they unfortunately didn’t have the soup I wanted so I waited to get that.  It was a small half marathon, but I wasn’t overly impressed with the logistics – namely running out of cups at the aid stations.  The course was really flat – probably too flat, but it got me out running and added another medal to my collection.

			I had planned 12, 13, and 10 mile long runs for the three weeks before my next half marathon.  I invited Sara to join me on my 13 miler, as another shot at the half while she was still in the half marathon mindset.  Sara’s stipulation was that she wanted a medal.  I of course made that happen so that she had to come run with me.  I planned the Seattle Waterways Unofficial Half Marathon that would take us from Gasworks along the Burke Gilman to the Montlake Bridge, around Portage Bay to Eastlake and around Lake Union, along the ship canal trail to the 15th bridge, and finally back to Gasworks along the Burke Gilman.  We lucked out and got a really nice, sunny day.  We met at 3pm, trying to get as much in before sunset around 4:30pm.  With no aid stations, we both ran with water, and I with some food (Shotbloks).  We kept up a great pace at just a little over 10 minutes for the first 10 miles, before we hit the steeper hill to get to 15th when we took our first and only ‘aid station’ walking break.  We made it across the bridge and as we hit the Burke Gilman again, I felt like we might be able to make Sara’s initial half goal of 2:15.  The last couple of miles were a struggle, but we made it back to Gasworks in the dark just under 2:16 – success!  A new PR for Sara and a fun training run for me.

			Next on the running schedule was the Mustache Dache 5K at Magnuson Park.  Alicia was coming back to visit and that sounded like a fun activity for Saturday.  I borrowed Ben’s hot dog costume to run in, while Sara and Robert brought out the Gorilla and Banana again, Alicia donned wings and a halo, and Aaron and Matt had tiger ears.  Of course everyone also had a mustache – mine was blue.

			<p>
			We assumed it’d be a typical Seattle fall day with rain and clouds, but it turned out to be a great, sunny day.  There were a couple thousand people running in the dache so we had a hard time trying to make our way to the back of the starting area, but otherwise it worked out pretty well.  That was my first run at Magnuson Park and running on the trail along Lake Washington was really pretty.  I think the hot dog costume even helped keep me warm and comfortable throughout the day.  We finished and enjoyed our chocolate mustache lollipops.  Woodinville Bicycle even provided free event photos from throughout the race which was awesome!

			They had mustache and costume competitions so Sara, Robert, and I went up on stage when it was finally time for the costume part.  Instead of letting the announcer talk for me, I channeled my inner Ben and the movie Accepted and said, “In honor of men’s health month – ask me about my wiener!” I ended up winning first place while Sara and Robert took home second.  If only we could have gotten Dustin up there with his giraffe, I think we could have swept the competition.  They had a beer garden and mechanical bull and a big bash, but instead we headed for food and home since we had kegs and a graduation party awaiting us.  Overall it was a fun event though.  It’s nice to do some not-so-serious races once in a while.

			Finally it was the week of the Seattle Half Marathon, also Thanksgiving, and I was tapering with a 2 and 3 mile run.  I think speeding up my training plan for the half in October had bothered my shins a bit so I had been icing them in the final weeks of training and was glad for a bit of a break.  We decided to avoid the potential craziness of Black Friday and went downtown on Saturday to pick up our race packets at the Westin Hotel.  We got lucky and showed up when Danielle and Lina were there as well, so we met up.  I didn’t have to wait in any line to get my bib, and only a short line for my goody bag and race shirt.  Afterwards we walked around the expo a little and Lina and I both got compression sleeves.  Aaron, Danielle, and Sara all seem to like running in them so I figured it’d be worth trying, besides we got a discount at the expo.  They measured me and outfitted me with some bright orange ones, which I plan to try out post half marathon.  After meandering around a bit more we headed out, and got some food for our pasta feed that night.
			</p>
			<p>
			The half marathon started at 7:30am, while the full marathon started at 8:15am.  I wanted to get there with plenty of time to find my way around and get my gear checked so we hopped on the 26 bus just after 6am, and got to Memorial Stadium a little after 6:30am.  We sat in the bleachers and tried to stay warm.  Luckily the rain forecast changed from Saturday to Sunday so there wasn’t supposed to be any rain during the race, but the wind still stuck around.  An average of 18 – 20 mph with gusts up to 38 mph – gross!  The temperature was at least fairly constant throughout the race time as well, varying from 48 to 50 degrees.  I decided to wear a medium weight long sleeve shirt, along with my capris and hat for the rain.  Once I found out there was no rain predicted I left the hat in my bag and ran with my buff headband, since I needed something to help keep my hair out of my face in the wind.  It felt fairly warm so I left my new mittens behind too.  We had saved our foil blankets from the Snohomish half marathon to use as we waited for the Seattle races to start.  We figured we could throw them on the side of the road after we started instead of ditching clothes.

			<p>
			Lina and I checked our bags and grabbed our foil blankets. I didn’t really have a goal in mind, I just figured I’d probably finish between 2:10 and 2:15 based on my normal pace.  During my last long runs, I tried doing hilly routes and was managing to stay around a 9:45 pace.  Lina decided to run a little slower and stick with me for the race.  As we were waiting in line for the porta potties, a photographer from the <a href="http://seattletimes.com/ABPub/zoom/html/2022376733.html">Seattle Times</a> introduced herself and said to keep doing what we were doing.  For the next few minutes, as we moved forward in line, she took pictures of Lina and I. She got our names and thoughts about the weather, and then we headed to the start line.  Kind of a funny thing but I guess we were quite the sight wrapped up in our foil blankets.  Danielle didn’t have a blanket so I left mine with her and shared Lina’s as we waited for the start.  We lined ourselves up just a little back from the 2:15 pacer, figuring that would help keep us from starting too quickly.
			</p>
			<p>
			We started down 5th Ave in the sea of runners. As it turns out, I had only run a couple very tiny sections of the course in my training runs so it was all pretty new.  It was kind of fun getting to run through the buildings downtown, and they provided a great wind block for us.  We got knocked around at a few intersections but nothing too bad.  Soon we were heading up the ramp for the I-90 express lanes when Emily Wheeler caught up to us.  We had conquered a couple of the small hills so far, with Galer and Interlaken looming ahead for us.  Lina assured me Galer was the worst though and was only a couple of blocks long, so I didn’t have anything to worry about.  She trained a lot better than I did and ran the hilly part of the course.  I wasn’t sure how running in a race with several thousand runners would be since all of the races I have done have been pretty small.  Turns out it wasn’t an issue at all, and it was kind of fun seeing the sea of runners ahead of us.  We had to weave a little bit but no more than usual I think. I was surprised that at every porta potty along the course there was a line of people, but I guess that comes with the large number of runners.  We passed the first aid station at mile 2 but grabbed some Gatorade at mile 4 in the express lane tunnel.  The tunnel was warm, and I was kind of glad for the cooler air when we exited to head up Lake Washington Blvd.
			</p>
			<p>
			We both ate a little something somewhere between mile 5 and 6, and grabbed some more Gatorade at another aid station.  There were people along Lake Washington cheering us on, which is always fun to see.  Lina was having a great time high fiving them and thanking most everyone for coming out to support the runners.  We reached Galer and Lina trucked up it, while I down shifted into granny gear to make it up.  It wasn’t too bad, especially considering it was short.  Lina ran backwards until I reached her, and then we set off at a slightly slower pace up Madison as I tried to actively recover.   I was feeling pretty good by time we hit Interlaken, luckily we had some downhill sections to help too.  I hadn’t gotten to run Interlaken during my training but I had run nearby Lynn to try and get an idea of the elevation gain.  I didn’t quite believe Lina when she said it was an easy roller, but turns out it was.  Maybe it was the chatting that distracted me but after the initial start up Interlaken, it wasn’t too bad.   It was nice winding through the trees with spectators cheering us on.  My right hip flexor was bothering me a bit but nothing that stopped or slowed me down, I think.  We grabbed Gatorade and water and a couple more aid stations along with a little more food about mile 10, the last for us throughout the race. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We exited Interlake and crossed I-5 on Roanoke to head towards South Lake Union.  We had just a few miles left and I was feeling pretty good.  At about 1.5 – 2 miles out, it looked like I might have a shot at beating my PR – 2:09 from the Wenatchee half.  Just a little over a mile out Lina mentioned this to me, to which I replied I just wanted to keep running. I still was avoiding any pressure of goals.  Turns out we got faster each mile over the last three miles.  The last mile had a bunch of downhill and we flew down them, passing a bunch of people.  The final hill on Mercer wasn’t too bad and we were soon rounding the corner into the stadium.  I had a new PR in sight, and as we hit the turf I kicked.  Lina saw me take off and did the same, so we finished at a good run and of course, with a heel kick.  2:07:38 was our official time with a pace of 9:45, a new PR for both of us!  We shuffled into the exhibition hall with the recovery area and found some bananas and chocolate milk.  We were both disappointed at the lack in food choices post race and really wanted some pretzels and cookies.  I was kind of surprised with such a huge event that they didn’t offer more.  We got our gear back, put some warm clothes on, and sat in the stands in the stadium to wait for Aaron and Danielle to finish the marathon.  They were hoping to finish around 3:30 which would put them crossing about 11:45am.

			</center>
			<p>
			We walked down to the final chute about 11:15am to cheer on all of the finishers as the marathoners were just starting to cross.  It was a lot of fun watching them, some people sprinting, others looking like they were just out for a lazy run and they hadn’t just run 26 miles.  Finally we spotted Aaron coming down the chute, with Danielle just a little behind him.  They finished at 3:45, PRs for both of them!  Aaron had developed a blister on his foot and apparently the wind had really picked up and made going down the last downhills work.  Lina and I lucked out with the weather!  After the marathoners got some recovery time and food, we found a bus and headed home for more food.  I only had eaten two bananas, 4 shotbloks, and the little chocolate milk that day so I was hungry.  The Seattle Half was a lot of fun.  The course was fun, not quite as intimidating as I initially thought, there was great support and spectators along the course, the weather turned out pretty well for us, and I PRed!  I only wish they had a bit more junk food post race for recovery.  All in all, a pretty successful and fun running season for 2013.
