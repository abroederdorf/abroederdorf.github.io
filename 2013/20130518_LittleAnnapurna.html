			<h1>Little Annapurna 5.18.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			I had a lot of fun on our Enchantments day trip last year when Sara and I tagged Dragontail and Colchuck, so when the opportunity presented itself to head back in I was stoked.  The weather looked a little wet everywhere in the mountains again.  Mt St Helens didn't look great - I'm still holding out for a nice day to go tag it.  I kind of wanted to head up and try Silver Star again (one of the peaks I owe Sara) but the weather didn't look great there either.  Tatoosh looked rainy so we decided scrambling up the rock would be better in drier weather.  The best of the worst appeared to be out in Leavenworth.  A 30% chance for rain, but partly sunny.  I figured if it said sun anywhere in the forecast, we should head there.  Once we had figured out the area, we had to decide on peaks.  I got permits for Labor Day weekend this year so we're planning on climbing Prusik one day, and then doing one or two walk-ups the other day.  Trying to coordinate with that, and looking at what would be feasible coming in from Colchuck Lake, we decided on Enchantment Peaks and Little Annapurna.  Sara may have mentioned two peaks and I ran with it, thinking that was a great rule for the Enchantments.  Nothing was set in stone and we figured we'd decide once we got up Aasgard Pass on the peak(s) we'd go after.  Looking back through our planning and trip report from our Enchantment Day Trip Adventure Part I: Dragontail and Colchuck, we figured we'd be on about the same time table and wanted to get an early start.  The plan was to head out to Leavenworth after work and find a campsite, so that we could hit the trail around 5/5:30am.  Just like last year, ICC changed locations late in the week as well and everyone was suddenly heading to Leavenworth for the weekend.  We decided to try and meet up with Aaron and crew again, only this time everyone had their own gear.
			</p>
			<p>
			We met the guys at Munchen Haus in Leavenworth for some sausage and pretzels, then we took off to find a camp site.  We were planning on waking up at 4am so we wanted to get to bed as soon as possible.  We started down Icicle Creek road, checking every campground along the way.  No available campsites at Eightmile, Bridgecreek, or Lower Johnny Creek - eerily similar to last year.  Finally, we found a few open spots in Upper Johnny Creek and claimed site #48 for ourselves and the guys.  They planned to come find us, so we paid for everything and I stuck a note on the board to let them know where we were at.  I went to bed about 10pm, knowing I'd have to wake up and shuffle cars when the guys finally arrived.  About 11:30pm we heard them.  They accidentally found us.  After stumbling out of the tent to tell them they were loud, and see if they wanted to move cars, I went back to enjoy my remaining 4.5 hours of sleep.
			</p>
			<p>
			The alarms went off and we woke up.  We had our part of camp packed up and were in the car heading to the trailhead by 4:25am.  There weren't many cars at the trailhead, one couple who had slept there getting were ready at the same time as us.  Sara remembered her gaiters and I made sure to put the duct tape in my pack.  I ate half a bagel quick, got a permit, and we hit the trail by 5:10am - not too bad.  It was already pretty light as sunrise was supposed to be around 5:20am, so no headlamps were needed.

			<p>
			We took a very quick break about a mile and a half mile in to shed some layers, and stopped again at the trail split to Colchuck Lake to grab some quick food and put on our gaiters.  There were a few patches of snow above the split but nothing too solid until we hit the lake.

			<p>
			As we were nearing the lake I was starting to crash a little.  I tried to eat some quick food as we moved, but I wanted a little more time to eat at the lake.  I also figured it'd be a good time to apply sunscreen.  Sara led around the lake to our usual rock sitting area.  We had our first good view of Aasgard Pass.

			</center>
			<p>
			Conditions looked a little different from the previous year, a little less snow than I expected actually.  We could see the debris path down from Dragontail, and figured out where we wanted to go up.  It was a lot colder at the lake than I expected, and not being able to wear my mittens while eating and applying sunscreen, my hands soon went numb.  Eventually we figured it was a lost cause sitting there and started moving again, as we had quite a ways to go before we hit Aasgard Pass.  Sara was playing mitten warmer and kept switching me warm mittens. Once we broke out of the trees and started traversing around the south end of the lake, I finally got blood flow back in my fingers.  We spotted two groups of two heading up the pass, each taking slightly different lines than we intended.  We also spotted a person heading up North Buttress Couloir on Colchuck.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Looking up at Colchuck</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We picked our way across the boulders, following steps for a little while before losing them.  We stayed lower on the hillside and thus had to deal with the trees.  Sara was doing a great job of finding all of the holes already.

			<p>
			We crossed a large avalanche debris field at the bottom of the Colchuck glacier and kept traversing towards the bottom of the pass.  The snow was very hard, and we were just barely able to kick our boot edges and toes in.  Finally we decided it was time to put our snowshoes on, and being close to the bottom of the pass, we decided to grab ice axes and helmets right away too.

			</center>
			<p>
			After heading up the bowling alley that is Aasgard Pass last year, I was more than ready to put my helmet on.  The snowshoes were awesome.  We got great purchase and the heel ascenders were a life saver.  We made pretty good time (for us at least) and covered 1200' in about an hour.  At 7,000' we took a quick break on some rocks.  The sound of the rushing water nearby convinced us to put our snowshoes away and head up the rocks.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Rocks we followed up</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			The rock path included large boulders, some of which moved, and a bunch of smaller stuff that all slid.  It made for slower gain as we picked our way carefully up, but we stayed away from the rushing water and potential hidden holes.  There were a couple of people who had gone up the rocks ahead of us, so we used the steps they had kicked through the small snow patches and followed their tracks to the top of Aasgard Pass.  It was about noon by time we hit the top.  Not knowing how much the snow would soften up in the pass, we wanted to leave ourselves plenty of time, especially because we were planning on descending part of it on the slow rocks.  We decided we should be back at the top of the pass by 3pm.  Only having three hours, my hopes of two peaks was quickly pushed aside.  Of course the weather blew in when we hit the top of the pass, obscuring our view of the summit of both Enchantment Peak and Little Annapurna.  Knowing Little Annapurna is a straightforward walk up, we decided to head for that with the time crunch in mind.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">First view into the Enchantments</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We had to drop down from the pass, traverse across/around Isolation Lake, and then head up about 700' to the summit.  I got a few pictures as the clouds moved through the basin.  We never did see the top of Enchantment Peaks, but I did find Prusik in the distance.

			</center>
			<p>
			The basin was mostly snow and rock, but I love the rock of the Enchantments.  There's something almost mesmerizing about it.  We put our snowshoes back on and followed some tracks over towards Little Annapurna.  Isolation Lake had a few blue spots where the snow was melting out, so we stayed close to the edge.  
			</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Heading around the edge of Isolation Lake, with Little Annapurna hidden in the clouds in the distance</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We knew we'd encounter a ridge heading up to a separate local high point from Little Annapurna.  With the visibility as it was, we hoped the tracks up from the lake would traverse over where we wanted to go once atop the ridge.  They mostly kept going up, so Sara directed me which way to head up.  There was a lot of traversing (right thigh burn!) as we tried to avoid losing elevation.  There was a saddle around 8100' that we were aiming for, but it was hard to distinguish the features of the slope in the almost white-out like conditions.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Awesome conditions as we head up Little Annapurna</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Finally the clouds lifted a little and we could see the final 350' up to the summit, the traverse was over!  There were rocks poking through the snow near the top, and every so often my snowshoes would hit rock beneath the surface.  I picked my way through the rocks and headed towards what looked like the high point.  It was blowing snow, almost small wet ice particles, but there wasn't any great protection.  I settled in next to some rocks and ate some more food.  The puffy felt great and as soon as we had refilled our energy reserves, we started down.

			<p>
			With snow conditions as they were, and not loving descending in snow shoes, we decided to plunge step down.  Unfortunately we had to traverse back so there was no glissading for us.  Luckily the snow was pretty good for plunge stepping, although we found many holes near the rocks.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Plunge stepping down from the summit to Isolation Lake</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We followed our tracks down as I tried to see things through the clouds.  We were still in a sea of white but could distinguish nearby ridgelines more easily.  We decided to cut straight back across Isolation Lake and continue following our tracks back, including a hundred feet or so of gain to the pass.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Following our tracks from Is<span style="font-size: small;">olation</span> Lake back up to the top of the pass</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Not enjoying some of the rushing water we noticed on the way up, we decided to follow our tracks down, including picking our way down the rocks.  It wasn't too horrible and before long we stepped back on the snow.  It had softened just enough to get some good steps in.  Every so often the snow would ball up under my boot, causing me to slip and glissade/slide a few feet until I could stop myself.  After figuring out why I kept sliding, I started clearing the snow off my boot by knocking it with my trekking pole.  Apparently I needed anti-snow balling plates for my boots.

			<p>
			We didn't see anyone the rest of the day after spotting the two earlier groups heading up Aasgard Pass.  However, we found their glissade chutes and boot ski tracks on the way down.  With the water and rock hazards, and knowing there were lots of rocks in the snow, we opted not to glissade.  Sara did try her hand at some boot skiing down closer to the lake though.

			</center>
			<p>
			My shoulder had done fairly well throughout the trip, only really bothering me when I was bent over more, like using my ice axe a few times up Aasgard Pass.  Knowing I still had a 4.5+ mile hike out, followed by several hours in the car, I decided I should take advantage of the snow and ice my shoulder before we were back on the trail leading around the lake.  We followed tracks back around the south end of the lake, and when we were almost to the trail, Sara found a nice rock to lounge on while I laid on the snow for 10 minutes.

				<span class="caption">Heading around the south end of Colchuck Lake</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			There were lots of people camping at the lake as we passed by, taking advantage of the few weeks before permit season starts.  The water was rushing really good at all of the stream crossings, and frequently down the trail.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Rushing water along the trail</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We knew the last 4.2 miles out were going to be the worst part of the day, so we went into descend mode and tried making good time as we picked our way down the trail.  At the trail split we stopped to take our gaiters off since we wouldn't be in any more snow, and I took the opportunity to retie my boots.  The rest of the trail out is much less rocky so we made good time on the last couple miles.

			I got back to the car at 7:25PM, 14 hours and 15 minutes after we had started that morning.  We decided to head back to Seattle that night, and figured we'd stop for dinner later during the trip to help wake ourselves up.  After waking up at 4am in Leavenworth, I was getting into bed at 11PM in Seattle after a great day of climbing into the Enchantments and ticking another Washington top 100 peak off my list.
			</p>
			<p>
			I'm guessing I'll be heading back in for more trips in the future, so I figured a detail break down of our climb would be useful for planning:
