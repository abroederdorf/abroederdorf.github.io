			<h1>Leavenworth - BOEALPS Spring Campout 4.20.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was time for the BOEALPS spring campout in Leavenworth, and after my race Saturday morning (assuming I wasn't too sore or tired) I planned on climbing a bit.  I've mostly been focused on snow climbs and the volcanoes this year so I hadn't been outside on rock yet.  In fact, I had hurt my shoulder finishing a route on the roof at the gym at the end of February, and had been trying not climb as much in hopes it'd heal.  Post race I wasn't feeling too bad.  I had a blister and a sore toe on my right foot, but no hip flexor or knee issues like I had gotten after my last two 13 mile runs, so I was good to go to try some climbing.  Sara had e-mailed me that they were headed to Surf City and that I should look for Aaron's jeep, not too far up Icicle Creek road.  I found Aaron's jeep, and after seeing how packed the pulloffs were, finally found somewhere to park along the road.  I cleaned up a bit and changed into fresh clothes, grabbed my pack, and set off up the road.  I'm not sure why, but I assumed they'd be in an area easy to find since I had never been to Surf City, so I didn't pull the book out to find the area.  I found a well established trail not far from Aaron's jeep and started up it.  I followed the trail for a while until I heard voices, at which point I headed up hill in search of the group.  I passed one woman reading on the hillside; I saw another couple of guys up a ways, looking like one was teaching the other something; and I saw a group off climber's left.  I watched them for a little while and tried to figure out if it was the group, but the colors just didn't quite seem to match up.  I wasn't really in the mood for traipsing all over the hillside so I acquiesced and got my book out to see where Surf City was.  It seemed like I had gone too far climber's right, and not being sure the group was mine nor wanting to walk all the way over, I headed down to hike along the road in search of the trail.  In the book it looked like there was a giant boulder near the trail, so when I found one I headed back in.  I kept looking uphill trying to find people but didn't see anything, and still not wanting to cimb uphill a bunch for nothing, traversed through the trees instead.  I popped back out on the road and kept walking, passing Mountaineers Dome - too far.  I walked back along the road, looking uphill with no luck, so I gave up.  I grabbed my post race apple and ate it alongside the road, hoping they might spot me.  Finally I decided it was time to head back to the warm car for a nap.

			A few hours later, after a nap and some reading, they came down and found me in my car.  After some lunch, we split up.  I went with Sara and Angie to Playground Point to do a leading lesson.  We located the trail after a short false start up the trail to Clamshell and found a 5.5, Tea Party, for Angie to get her first lead on.  After Sara went over the basics of clipping, Angie was ready to challenge the route.

			I scrambled up a few bolts to get some pictures while Angie started off.  She did great, getting all of her clips right.  The route had 8 bolts so it gave her many chances to practice.

			As she lowered it was time for me to try and downclimb.  The ledges were a bit sandy so Angie came over on the rope to give me a hand down until I felt ok for the rest of the downclimb.  The route looked like fun, and not having gotten to climb yet, I volunteered to follow and clean.  Not wanting to go back down to my pack to get my shoes and harness, I borrowed Sara's harness and climbed in my approach shoes.  Nothing like approach shoes to make a climb a little more challenging.  I found just enough small nubbins and ledges and made it to the anchor.

			Sara decided to head up and try a 5.7 she hadn't climbed yet.  Chris and Melissa were also nearby at Playground Point and had an issue with their rope.  The knot was still in when they tried pulling it so the rope was stuck a couple bolts up.  The options were for us to give Chris our rope so he could rappel down and retrieve his rope, or for one of us to re-lead it.  It looked like a fun route with a bulge to pull over, but well protected.  Sara, having lead some routes earlier in the morning, offered to let me take the lead.  I grabbed my shoes and harness and started up.  All of Chris's quickdraws were still on route so I just had to clip as I went.  I reached the rope and unknotted it so Chris could finish pulling it, and continued on with the climb.  Just below the bulge is a little traverse section, and after picking which seam I wanted to take across (I picked the lowest one) I made my way up to the bulge.  Chris said he went left to sort of skirt around it.  I checked the move out.  There was a small crack I tried jamming some fingers in but that didn't work.  There was a sort of fingertip crystal nub on the rock that gave me just enough leverage to swing my feet over and pull myself up - success.  After that it was just low angle slab to the anchor, with horrendous rope drag thanks to the bolt protecting the roof.  I grabbed the draws on my way down to help reduce some of the rope drag so Melissa could climb it.  Angie was the last one to head up, then we grabbed our gear and headed for the cars.  I didn't realize it was already 7pm, time to head back to camp and grab some potluck food!  Sunday we headed back to Seattle early, but at least I got a couple routes in during the weekend.  Being on the rock made me more excited for climbing season though, I sometimes forget how much I like rock climbing.  Nothing like running a half marathon and doing a little rock climbing all in a day.  I think that just means I'm ready for some alpine climbing - now to wait for the good weather at the end of July/August.
