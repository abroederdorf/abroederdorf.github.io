			<h1>Mount Teneriffe 4.27.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was looking like another rainy weekend in the mountains.  Despite the bleak weather forecast, I hadn't been out in the mountains in a couple weekends and wanted to get some elevation in.  Still looking to tag Mt St Helens, we decided the weather there just didn't make it worth it.  We're still hoping for a nice day for that climb.  There was potential of getting up high enough to be in snow instead of rain if we went up the Muir Snow field, but that's a bit of a drive for a one day training hike.  The rain was forecast to hit around 11am so we figured we'd find a good training hike close to home and deal with the rain.  Not being inspired or motivated to head anywhere in particular, we finally decided on Mount Teneriffe late Friday night.  I had finally gone to the doctor Thursday and found out I have a muscle tear and bursitis in my left shoulder.  I was told not to rock climb and run (too jarring) so I asked about mountain climbing and got the OK.  I'm going to guess my doctor didn't really understand my definition of mountain climbing.  In light of my new known condition, we decided to go light.  Most trip reports we found sounded like the trail was mostly snow free so we just brought some rain gear, bare essentials, and trekking poles.

			Sara picked me up at 7am and we headed to North Bend.  Mount Teneriffe is the next summit down the ridge from Mount Si.  Sara had tried climbing it with Kevin after work a couple years prior but they missed a turnoff and hiked up the road for a while before being turned back by the dark.  There seemed to be many options for hiking up the mountain, varying in length from 8 miles to 14 miles round trip.  It was about 4,000' in elevation which sounded like some good training to me.  After waiting a while at the North Bend Ace Hardware to get a Discovery Pass, we were headed to the trailhead.  There were several cars already there - looked like we'd have some company.  It was overcast, but not yet rainy, when we started around 8:30am.  We were looking for an obvious turnoff to the right from the road, and questioned several distinct looking trails, but we continued up the road.  Finally we got to a fork in the road, and seeing a baby cairn, decided to take it.  The road soon petered out to more of a trail through the trees.  The first couple miles were pretty flat so we were making some good time.

			Soon we came upon a fork in the trail with a sign indicating Teneriffe Falls were that way.  My left shoulder was a little sore so I hadn't been using my trekking pole and instead had my arm hugged across my body, gripping my pack strap in an attempt to protect my shoulder a bit.  I stopped to put my unused trekking pole away  before continuing up the fork.  We headed up along the creek with many little falls, getting bigger as we got higher.  We started up the switchbacks across a talus slope, never straying too far from the stream.

			Finally we reached the main fall, Kamikazee Falls I believe, and took a few pictures.  The trail beyond that was suppose to get steep and definitely did.  I was trying not to use my left arm/shoulder as much as possible, so continued up with my one arm following Sara.  The trail was kicking my butt, so when we reached the ridge we found some nice flat rocks to grab a snack break.

			As we sat there we felt the first rain drops of the day, but nothing too bad.  Fueled up, Sara lead off, following the ridge up.  There was still a pretty distinct trail we followed.  Soon we were in the trees and just kept to the ridgeline as we picked our way up the slope, starting to encounter small patches of snow.

			Much to our surprise, in the few clearings we got snowed on - not rained on.  I didn't think the snow level was suppose to be that low but we lucked out.  Before long we hit solid snow on what seemed like the never ending ridge.  Sara had worn her approach shoes while I had my mountaineering boots, so just a little below the summit she let me take lead to help kick some steps up.

			We mostly followed some down tracks and were soon heading up the final open bit to the summit.  It was windy and blowing snow in my face, so after a few quick pictures we went down to the cover of the trees.

			Once in the trees we got out our gaiters, and I plunged stepped down - trying to avoid the jarring of the icy steps.  We continued picking our way down the slope and were soon back in the trees.

			It was fairly steep so it was a bit of an art picking your way down over the loose sticks, pine needles, and pine cones strewn on the ground.  Still only using my right arm and the one trekking pole, I was a bit slow following Sara down.  I kept stepping on small branches/sticks and sliding, one time going down hard on my water bottle resulting in a very nice bruise to remember it by.  I was ready for lunch so we continued on until we found a relatively flat spot and stopped.  We figured I'd be pretty slow once we left the ridge, through the steep section above the falls.  We had passed a couple guys on the way to and from the summit, but for the most part we had the trail to ourselves.  As soon as we hit the falls we found all the people, and the rain.  I kept my arm protectively wrapped across my body as I picked my way across the talus slope.  I was happy to get back to the fork and on the relatively flat path.  My shoulder was sore so Sara helped me tighten my pack strap around it like a sling for the final couple miles out on the road.  A fairly uneventful hike and not much in terms of views or weather, but it was good to get out and get some elevation in.</p>
