			<h1>Mount Hood 3.30 - 3.31.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			Aaron and I had been watching the forecast for Mount Hood over the last couple of months, waiting for a good weather weekend to go down and climb it.  Our first attempt was ended before we even left Seattle by illness, so we were lucky to find another opportunity so quickly.  The forecast called for sunshine and fairly warm temperatures, about 35 for a high and 25 for a low at 9000'.  Unfortunately the sun and warmer temperatures created a big avalanche danger as well.  We recruited Niki and Alex to join us and anxiously waited for the avalanche report to come out for the weekend.  Friday it was showing moderate everywhere except the sun facing slopes (south aspect) which was considerate.  We all agreed we'd give it a go if stayed at considerate and didn't go to high.  We were planning to summit before sunrise so we figured we could help mitigate our risk by getting out of the most avalanche prone section of the route before the sun really hit it.  We'd have to see how we felt about camp near the Triangle Moraine as we went up Saturday since we'd be up there late afternoon.  I packed up Friday night and got excited for Mount Hood.  This being the year of the volcano, I wanted to get one checked off the list.  Also with my past history of unsuccessful volcano attempts, I was really anxious to have a good trip to help build some confidence for going into Mount Baker and Mount Rainier.  To increase my chances of success, we were using a relaxed approach.  We intended to climb the standard south route up the old chute.  We'd start Saturday about noon, camp around 9200', and start up for the summit about 3:30am on Sunday, to get back to the car by noon.  A lot of people do the climb in one day starting from the Timberline Lodge at midnight.

			We left Seattle Saturday morning just after 7am and picked Alex up on our way down.  After a breakfast stop at Starbucks and a couple of pit stops (we were hydrating well) we arrived at the Timberline Lodge just after noon.  We self registered at the little climbing area, bought a sno-park permit, and geared up.  I even brought my sun hat for the weekend since I knew it was suppose to be so nice.  I was able to pack a little lighter too, leaving the foam sleeping pad, big puffy, and heavy shell at home.  We didn't intend to rope up so we just had our normal overnight gear with snowshoes, crampons, ice axes, and helmets.  After a quick pre-climb-parking-lot sandwich, we started off about 1pm.  The first time I had tried Mount Hood I had some terrible breathing issues and ended up turning around about 6500'.  In order to avoid that, I kept my pace very slow and brought up the rear of the pack.  After we got up on the snow from the parking lot, we followed the cat tracks up so we didn't use our snowshoes.  Niki was out front kicking steps the whole way, from the parking lot at just over 5900' to camp at about 9300'.  We took a few breaks and Aaron mostly hung back with me.

			I was feeling good, just taking my time.  Despite the warm temperatures, mid 40's down at the lodge, it was pretty nice out.  The winds of 20 mph with gusts up to 29mph didn't quite materialize luckily, but there was a nice light wind to keep us cool in the sun.

			<p>
			We made our way up past the Silcox warming hut at about 7000', talking to a ski patrol guy there a little bit.  I had made it farther than I had on my first attempt, a small victory on my way to the top.  The lift above that wasn't running so we hiked along it to the Palmer Lift Hut at the top at about 8500'.  We took a little longer break there before continuing up.

			The cat tracks ended there so Niki led us over to the boot pack and we started up.  I was still feeling pretty good.  There was what looked like a flat area not too far up that we figure would be good for camp so up we went.  The flat area turned out to be a gentle roll at around 9200'.

			<p>
			We had gotten up to our desired minimum altitude for camp, so Niki and Aaron set off in search of some flat ground.  Among some ice piles they found the best they could in the area.  That last couple hundred feet up to camp took a toll on me and I was not feeling good when I reached them.

			Aaron was really nice and cut/dug a tent platform for us while Niki and Alex melted snow for water.  Aaron set the tent up along with my sleeping stuff so I could take a nap, in hopes of feeling better.  We were trying out his brand new Mountain Hardwear Direkt 2 for the weekend, a nice light four season tent.

			I half napped for a while and woke up not feeling particularly great but a little better.  I drank a little and improved some, so I ate a few bites of my Mountain House meal and the rest of my ShotBloks from the hike up, trying to get some calories in me.

			The view from camp was gorgeous with the crater above us and Mount Jefferson, Three Fingered Jack, and Mount Washington in the distance.  I got my pack ready for the next day and grabbed the items I needed for that night.  I continued drinking water while enjoying the awesome sunset.  Alex started not feeling so great during dinner so she went to bed a little before us.  We finished everything up just as the sun dipped below the horizon - perfect timing.

			We went to bed about 8pm.  At 9pm both Aaron and I woke up for a bathroom break.  I was glad I did too because it was a pretty awesome view from up there.  The stars were out, the ski resort across the way was lit up for night skiing, and you could see the Portland area lights to the west. The moon was nice and bright too so I didn't even have to use a headlamp.

			The alarm went off at 3am and Aaron woke me up, asking if I wanted to try for the summit.  I did so we all got ready.  Alex still wasn't feeling great but decided to try too if I was going.  It was cold when I wasn't completely curled up in my sleeping bag so Aaron shared his bag with me.  I ate a Gu and piece of cheese, trying to get some calories in me.  Wanting to stay together as a group, I led off at my slow pace at about 3:45am.  We left the snowshoes behind, but I decided to start up with my trekking poles until we got to the steeper section.  There were a few headlamps already above us and several more below.

			As we were hiking up some guys lit off a couple fireworks even, a fun sight but very unexpected.  It was pretty chilly and I wasn't moving very fast so we had some layers on.  I had Niki grab my overmitts for me at one of our stops, and most of them had puffys on.  Our waters were starting to freeze too, which meant the bite valve on my Camelbak froze and I started having to stop to get water from my normal Nalgene.  I was feeling pretty good until we hit about 10,000', then my stomach was not very happy.  Within a hundred feet or two of Hogsback I was feeling really bad and threw up.  I continued up to Hogsback where there was a nice flat section and we grouped up at about 5:45am.  I sat to take a rest while Aaron talked to me about continuing on or not.  I was feeling a little better but still not great. I ate a little food and tried walking around, but still didn't feel good so I made the hard decision to turn around within 800' of the summit.  Alex wasn't feeling too bad so she and Niki continued up as Aaron and I headed down.  Another failed summit attempt along with feeling sick, my track record lives on.

			As a small consolation, the sunrise was amazing so I got lots of pictures as we made our way down past the groups still heading up.  There were several groups but it wasn't as crowded as I expected it to be.  There were lots of airplanes that flew over Mount Hood, making for some great pictures with their contrails.  </p>

			Aaron and I made it back to camp just before 7am.  Aaron wanted to get me down, thinking I'd feel better, and not knowing how long I'd have until I bonked with my minimal food consumption, so we packed up our half of camp and went down.  We made quick work of it and left just after 7:15am.

			<p>
			We had a good view of the cat tracks down so we picked a more direct path and stayed just off the cat track in the untracked, frozen snow.  We had taken our crampons off at camp and were going to boot down the rest of the way.  The snow was pretty frozen, taking some effort to get a heel in.

				<span class="caption">The famous Mount Hood shadow that forms a very nice triangle</span>

			The hike down is a little torturous because the parking lot is in view the entire time and doesn't seem that far away.  The sun was up and with it some great morning glows on the volcanoes nearby.

				<span class="caption">One last look at Mount Jefferson, Three Fingered Jack, and Mount Washington to the south as we head back to the car</span>

			<p>
			We made it back to the parking lot about 8:30am, changed, and headed into the lodge so Aaron could grab some hot chocolate.  We went back to the car to wait for Niki and Alex so I took a nap.  We kept trying to guess where they might be, and which pair of ants marching down the mountain they were.  About 11am they rolled into the parking lot, after having successfully summitted Mount Hood!  At least a couple people from our group got to the top!  After they got into some dry, happy clothes we headed for Government Camp for lunch at the brew pub before the long drive back to Seattle.  Overall it was a disappointing trip for me, but at least I got to spend a gorgeous weekend in the mountains with patient and understanding climbing partners and friends.
