			<h1>Wenatchee Half Marathon 4.20.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			Leading up to the Leavenworth Half Marathon last October I was really excited to get a break from running.  I wanted the race to be over so that I could go back to my normal routine, namely climbing more.  Within hours of finishing the half marathon, Aaron mentioned running the Seattle Half Marathon at the end of November and I was intrigued.  Apparently I wasn't quite ready to give up on running yet.  I gave myself a break from it the week following the half to let my body heal up a bit and I felt lazy not running.  I enjoyed the fact that I could go for a long-ish run and not be sore the next day.  I thought back to when I first started running and how I was sore for a week.  Wanting to avoid having to go through that process again I figured I should keep running.  It also couldn't hurt my fitness for alpine approaches.  Now that I didn't have an immediate race goal, I had to come up with a running plan.  As silly as it sounds, if I have something already scheduled on my calendar I'm more likely to go do it.  Aaron had wanted to keep doing long runs, which he had a different definition of than me following his marathon training.  My longest run before the half marathon was 10 miles, so we agreed to do that distance.  I didn't want my life to be run by running though, so I decided to do a long run every other week.  Looking back through my training plan, making new fake training plans with Smart Coach from Runners World, and having learned what sort of runs I enjoyed, I finally came up with a schedule.  My maintenance running plan had me running three days a week, something I felt I could manage, and also left my weekends open for playing in the mountains.  My first priority is climbing, running is just a secondary activity to keep myself in shape.  I planned to do a short run Monday, long run Tuesday, and medium run Thursday, letting me get to the climbing gym a couple times a week.  My plan has a basic repeating 4 week cycle:

			With my new running schedule established, I figured it was time to get a little more serious about running.  The advantage to doing a race in the fall meant I had the nice summer weather for training.  If I was going to keep running I'd have to figure out running in the winter, which meant cold and rain.  I had been running with my phone and the MapMyRun app, but after it failed me during the Leavenworth half marathon and not wanting to run with my phone in the rain, I figured I should invest in a GPS watch.  I already love using my GPS for climbing so I figured I'd enjoy having one for running too - yay data!  After doing a little research I settled on the Garmin Forerunner 410.  Next I e-mailed some of my running friends to find out what sort of clothing they used for running during the winter.  I e-mailed Alyssa, Danielle, and Zoë and got great feedback on what they like.  I ended up getting a running hat to keep the rain out of my eyes, a thicker long sleeve, and some long pants.  After getting my new running gear, I thought it time to come up with some new routes.  If I was going to be doing this running thing weekly, I needed to have a variety to pick from.  I came up with a few basic directions and would vary the routes to reach my various mileage requirements.  I like using MapMyRun for planning routes and their mobile app with the search filter for picking routes, but I'm starting to like Garmin Connect more for keeping track of things.  The convenience of wireless sync with my watch helps, but I still keep some of my own stats in a spreadsheet - of course.  I planned loops down around Greenlake, around the zoo, through the U-district, and around Wallingford.  For my longer runs I'd drive down and start from Gasworks so I had routes heading either west or east on the Burke Gilman, or heading around a combination of Portage Bay, Lake Union, and Elliott Bay.  In the end I came up with a total of 57 routes:

			Aaron started running with me again post half marathon, but my slower pace messed with his knee so I was soon mostly running by myself as he took some time to rest up.  Heading into the winter, the days were getting much shorter so I invested in some visibility gear including reflective bands, vest, and a light up armband.  I found a great little clip on light for my hat too.  It's like I was becoming a real runner.  I did pretty well keeping up with my runs.  I started watching the weather a lot, trying to move my runs around to take advantage of any non-rainy days if possible.  I ran on plenty of rainy days too, never trying to skip runs because of the weather.  The dark made it a little hard sometimes but I tried to stick to well traveled streets close to home since I was out by myself.  In December I found myself back in Illinois for a couple of trips, one for Zoë's wedding and another week at Christmas time.  I brought my running stuff with me and planned a couple routes there too.  It's amazing how flat Crystal Lake is compared to Seattle.

			I had the Wenatchee Half Marathon in mind for my next race.  It was during April, the weekend of the BOEALPS spring campout, so I thought that worked out well.  It wouldn't be a prime climbing weekend so I figured I could take a half day and do it.  The early bird registration, and lower fee, ended at the end of 2012 so I signed up just before Christmas.  I had created a new training plan that started 12 weeks before the half marathon so I could increase my mileage and feel like I was training. </p>

			My base of an average of 14 miles per week was nice to start from, and in reality, probably meant I didn't have to do any extra training to run a half but I figured why not, the race would be a good excuse to do something more.  It'd let me do some longer runs which I always think are the most fun anyways because you can really see a lot around the city.  I started my 12 week training plan at the beginning of February and planned a couple of 13 milers before my half.  For my first 13 miler I planned to run around Portage Bay and the south end of Lake Union, then heading down to Elliott Bay past the Space Needle, up to Ballard and back to Gasworks on the Burke Gilman.  Unfortunately that day was one of the rainy ones, although it was more of a cloud of swirling mist.  My rain hat offered no protection and I was pretty wet by mile 6.

			Another one of my favorite runs was a 6 miler when it was legitimately pouring outside.  A half mile in my shorts were plastered to my legs and I was wringing out my sleeves every time I had to stop at a light.  I'm glad most of the rainy days are Seattle rain days, trending more towards the light rain/mist.  Overall I don't feel like I had too many really bad rainy days to run in though, and still prefer running in the rain to running in a gym.  I just really prefer being outside, and I actually started liking hillier routes.  The first time I try a new hill it's a battle, sometimes including a break, but after knowing what to expect I do better the next time up.  It was nice too because I was more open to various routes since Seattle is pretty hilly. I don't feel confined to certain areas because of the terrain.  I've gotten comfortable with the 50th hill, hills in Wallingford, and the hills heading up from Greenlake.  Some of the most challenging ones I run are west on 65th from the Burke Gilman, heading up Ravenna, and the Edgar road hill I take to get up to Roanoke to head to Eastlake from Portage Bay.

			In February when I was about to start ramping up my training I figured it was about time to find a new pair of running shoes.  I had put a good 500 miles on my other ones.  I went back to Road Runner to find something like my Brooks Ravenna 3 pair that I really liked.  They had a lot of pink shoes which I wasn't crazy about.  I tried on the new Brooks Ravenna 4 and Asics GT 2000.  The Asics were very cushy, but I didn't know if that was a good thing.  With the Road Runner VIP deal you can try a new pair of shoes and return them within 90 days for a new pair if they're not working for you, so I figured I might as well try something new.  After getting the new Asics, I found some Ravenna 3's online for cheap so I ordered a new pair of those.  I knew I liked them so I figured it'd be good to have an extra pair.  I even got a different color, the fun black and yellow ones.  I ran about 30 miles in the Asics and noticed I was having some issues with my left knee.  I decided to try the new Ravenna 3's and that seemed to fix the problem.  Eventually I got back into Road Runner after my half marathon to return the Asics and I just got a new pair of Mizuno Wave Inspire 9 to try out.  A lof of my friends really seem to like Mizuno so I'm excited to try them out.  If I don't like them I'll probably go with the new Ravenna 4's by Brooks, although the Mizunos are a really fun blue.  After all, color is the most important feature of running shoes.

			I learned that if I run with someone else, even if they're faster than me, I tend to run slower.  I decided that I wanted to finish training for the half marathon by myself so I could push myself as I wanted on my runs and not worry about anyone else.  It also let me do my runs right after work so I'd still have most of the night to do stuff, like climb.  I'm not sure Aaron was too thrilled about being banned from my runs, but he did come on a couple I asked him to for added security later at night, which was nice of him.  He had also offered to run the half marathon with me, but I wanted to do one on my own so I figured this would be a good opportunity.  I didn't exactly follow my running plan but I was pretty close, only missing 21 miles of my plan.  I got sick and missed my short and long runs in week 6, and I did a medium run instead of my long run (my second 13 miler) during week 9 in preparation for my attempt on Mount Hood.  Another disadvantage about running during the winter is that the water fountains are shut off, so I picked up a hand held water bottle to bring on my runs, a small 10oz.  It worked really well for me as I don't like to have things around my waist.  I was able to carry an emergency Gu with me too since I'd be off on my own somewhere in the city during my long runs.

			The race was fast approaching.  We'd be camping in Leavenworth for the weekend so I planned to bring all of the warm gear that I could.  If I'm cold while camping I tend to sleep more scrunched up which makes my legs sore, and I wanted to be in good condition for the race.  After dinner in Leavenworth Friday night, I went back to the campground and went to bed while everyone else hung out around the campfire.  Registration was open from 6:30 - 7:30am the morning of the race, and I was just a little under an hour away at the campground.  I woke up at 5:30am Saturday morning and quickly got ready.  I was on the road by 5:45am and pulling into Wenatchee just after 6:30am.  I had managed to eat a bagel early in my drive, but as I neared Wenatchee I started not feeling so well.  I parked my car, picked up my bib, and hit the port-o-potties.  I went back to my car to hang out until the start of the race at 8am.  I had other food I had intended to eat but I couldn't bring myself to, and in fact, felt pretty nauseous.  After one more trip to the bathroom before the crowds descended, I got ready at my car.  I sent an e-mail to Aaron to let him know I wasn't feeling good and might take longer than expected.  My goals for the race were to finish in under 2:15, and if I could beat that, with a pace better than 10min/mile.  Not being able to eat much and not feeling good, I figured it was going to be a tough race but I was hoping I'd start to feel better once I got going.  I stretched and headed for the start line.  Finally the pacers joined the group and it was funny to watch everyone file back towards their desired pace, myself included.  After a moment of silence for the victims at the Boston Marathon, we were off.  I tried to align myself with about a 9:30 pace.  I had run my training 13 miler around a 9:45min/mile pace, so I figured I should be able to do something similar.

			I was doing pretty well during the first three miles and was managing a pace under 9:30min/mile.  Then my stomach caught up with me and I started Alicia burping (what I call throwing up in my mouth).  I probably do that on half of my runs so I wasn't too surprised, it just started early in my run and continued throughout.  I felt worse than normal though so I was afraid of losing what little nourishment I got throughout my race, but luckily nothing too bad happened.  I decided to walk through the water stations, and walked a couple other times to eat a Gu.  Normally on my long runs I get hungry about mile 6 - 8.  I never got hungry during the race but I would start feeling terrible, which I eventually realized was my body needing some energy so I would have a Gu.

			I had one Gu in my back pocket which I ate around mile 5.  They had more around mile 6.5 so I grabbed a new packet then and ate it around mile 9.  The course followed a nice path along the Columbia River and was actually hillier than I expected, although nothing terrible.  It was a an out and back but sort of in a loop form since it followed the river on both sides.  It was a warm, sunny day with a slight breeze.  The forecast was calling for some legit wind so I was glad that didn't pan out.  I think that's my most hated condition to run in.  I'll take rain any day over running in wind.

			</center>
			<p>
			From my distance vs speed vs elevation graph you can see my walking breaks.  A water station around mile 3, I walked for my first Gu just before mile 6, another water station just after mile 6, the Gu station at 6.5, another water station at mile 7, a Gu break just after mile 9 followed by a water station, and the final water station around mile 11.  The last few miles were a real struggle for me so I walked one more time after the last water station before I decided to suck it up for the last mile or so.  There were a few people along the route, some with cow bells, but it was much more low key than the Leavenworth Half Marathon.  I think there were about half the number of runners too, under 700 doing the Wenatchee half.

			The finish line was at the end of a pedestrian bridge.  There were several people I sort of ran near throughout the race with how our paces worked out, jockeying back and forth depending on who was taking walking breaks when.  I didn't think I had anything left but somehow managed to find enough energy to kick up the pedestrian bridge and pass a few people on my way to the finish line. The line of volunteers at the finish line were handing out medals, water, and an apple bar.  After taking a few steps away I remembered to stop my watch and found somewhere to sit while I recovered from my kick.

			After catching my breath I got up and wandered over to the food table to grab a banana, apple, and some pretzels.  I picked up my shirt and stood in line to get my official time.  I finished in 2:09:48 with a pace of 9:55min/mile.  I had achieved both of my goals!  I was still a little disappointed though as I knew I could have done better if I was feeling a little better.  Oh well, it was still a good goal to keep me running throughout the winter.

			I drove back to Leavenworth to meet up with the crew to do a little rock climbing.  I'm taking the summer off from races as I don't want to give up any weekends from climbing, but I'll continue to run with my maintaining plan.  I'm signed up for the Tough Mudder in October, and although not a running race specifically, it'll be good to keep up my long runs for that obstacle race.  After that I'm thinking the Seattle Half Marathon could be fun at the beginning of December.  Comparing my training runs for my second half marathon with those for my first, I was happy to see some improvement.  Granted I wasn't starting from scratch for my second half marathon, but I averaged longer runs, with more elevation, and a faster pace.  I'm no speed demon but I feel like I'm staying in shape, and have hopefully gotten a little faster in the mountains.  Following the half marathon I finally went to see the doctor about my left shoulder that I had hurt climbing at the end of February leading on the roof at the gym.  I found out that I have bursitis and a muscle tear, so my doctor said no rock climbing or running for at least a month while I head to PT to try and heal myself.  She said I could use the elliptical or run in a pool, so the elliptical it is.  Not only can't I run outside, I have to elliptical while watching everyone else rock climb.  Hopefully a month of rest and PT will see me back to normal so I can resume all my favorite activities.
