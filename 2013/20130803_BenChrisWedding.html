			<h1>Ben and Chris's Wedding Weekend with some climbing in Whistler and Squamish 8.3 - 8.4.13</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was Ben and Chris's wedding weekend in Whistler!  We got a condo for the weekend up in the village and figured any climbing we got in in between the festivities would be a bonus.  Our plan was to take Friday off and climb in Squamish on the way up, stay close to Whistler on Saturday and do some sport climbing nearby in the morning, and then climb in Squamish on the way through on Sunday.  Of course, after a summer of great weekends, the first weekend I can get on some rock the weather doesn't want to fully cooperate.  With the forecast calling for rain, we decided to sleep in on Friday and take our time getting up to Whistler.  We stopped for breakfast, did a little shopping at MEC in North Vancouver, and then stopped at the Britannia Mine Museum.  We drive by the museum on our way to Squamish/Whsitler every time so it was fun to stop and check it out.

			The highlight was definitely the train tour into the mine where we got to learn about some of the machinery they used.  We poked around some of the old buildings and the crew panned for gold, then we hit the road again for dinner in Squamish at our favorite -  Howe Sound brew pub.

			Full and happy, we finished the drive to Whistler and found the condo.  Sara booked us a nice one with a private hot tub on the porch.  After a nap, we relaxed in the hot tub before retiring for the night.  The weather forecast still wasn't looking great for Saturday but we were hoping to check out some of the nearby sport areas.  The guys found a couple areas that looked interesting in the guide book so the plan was to head that way in the morning.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Saturday morning we walked into the village to grab some breakfast.  I was extremely hungry for whatever reason so Aaron went to get some more substantial food with me.  We decided to check out the Cal-Cheak area a little south of Whistler, near Daisy Lake.  We parked at the basalt column road cut and took the short trail in, complete with a nice set of stairs.  I love how nicely the trails are developed up in Canada.  Since hurting my shoulder, I had done a couple of sport routes in Leavenworth at Playground Point and the ridge on Klawatti, so I wanted to start off easy and get my lead head back as well as dust off my gear placing skills.  Aaron figured starting on the easy stuff at Huckleberry Lane would be good for me, but there was already a group there so we continued up to Shelf Road.  It had a couple 5.7's so I took the one of the far left side of the rock while Aubrey led the one on the far right.  I grabbed my quickdraws and started up Piece of Cake (5.7).  It was a corner climb that was very mossy.  The corner was a little weird and pushed you off balance a bit as you went up.  After clipping the second bolt you go up a few ledges before reaching the third bolt, definitely run out and if I would have slipped for some reason, I would have decked.  The terrain was super easy though so it wasn't really an issue.

			<p>
			I topped out and Aaron cleaned it after me, moving the rope to the right one to The Gift (5.11b).  He had to climb Piece of Cake (5.7) a second time to clean the anchor and then lower down The Gift (5.11b).  Matt had put up Crazy Eights (5.9) so I top roped that next.  After an awkward start that I was too far left on, I got into the sequence of moves and enjoyed the fun climb up.

			Luke had moved the rope from Aubrey's lead over to <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/foul-language/108303842">Foul Language</a> (5.10b) so I just hung out as I was trying not to climb anything above a 5.9.  I hadn't been in the gym for a few weeks due to all of our visitors, but when I had started going again I limited myself to five climbs and 5.9 or under.  My physical therapist said I should stay at that for a couple weeks, and if I was feeling good, I could either increase intensity or quantity and slowly work my way back to my original level a couple weeks at a time.  I was trying not to overdo it outside either.  The rest of the crew got a lap in on The Gift (5.11b) and Foul Language (5.10b).  When everyone had finished on Crazy Eights (5.9) we pulled the rope and I quickly led A Tear Above (5.7).  It was a lot more fun than Piece of Cake (5.7).

			There was another area above Shelf Road but it mostly had harder stuff, so I elected to go down to Huckleberry Lane.  Everyone seemed ok with that so we all moved there.  We didn't have much time before we wanted to head back to get ready for the wedding, so we all jumped on a route to lead.  I took The Hard Way Home (5.7) while Sara took the one to the left of that, A Little Bit of Squamish (5.6).  They shared a start so after I got a bolt above that, Sara started up and just unclipped my rope from the draws.

			<p>
			The Hard Way Home (5.7) was a fun climb, with a few balancy moves through the very well protected crux.  After I lowered off that, I top roped A Little Bit of Squamish (5.6), a nice, easy climb.  After that I went up Luke's lead on Huckleberry Pluck (5.9).  It was a fun climb that had some very thin face moves up high.  I was definitely pulling and standing on crystals.  Aubrey wanted to get a lead in so she quickly led <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-first-step/108303809">The First Step</a> (5.7) and cleaned as she rappelled down.  It was time to head back to the condo and quickly cycle through the showers so we could get to the gondolas by 4:30pm to head up to the Roundhouse Lodge on Whistler for the wedding ceremony.

			We showed up to the Gondolas to find they were closed due to lightning in the area.  They weren't sure when they'd open again, so the wedding planner arranged for the Whistler maintenance trucks to come shuttle all the guests up the mountain.  It was definitely a new way up the mountain for me, basically off roading up the trails I'm sure we ski down.  Miraculously I didn't get sick and the ceremony started a little after we got up to the lodge.  All of the other events up there got canceled due to the storm, so it was kind of awesome to have everything to ourselves.  Despite a little rain, the ceremony was great and as the night went on, we were even treated to a gorgeous sunset over the mountains and a double rainbow.  Ben and Chris's wedding and reception was filled with love and it was a great night celebrating their marriage.  Luckily the storms had subsided so we got to download on the gondolas at the end of the festivities.

			Weather forecasts for Squamish on Sunday were showing potential rain again, and not wanting to get stuck on the Apron in bad weather, we opted to do single pitch stuff at Smoke Bluffs.  Again I was looking for some easy trad leads to get back into my rock climbing mind set.  I had done six climbs the day before and had started feeling my shoulder towards the end, but was feeling good Sunday morning.  We were looking at Funarama, and flipping a couple more pages in the book, I found Call It a Day.  It had three 5.6 routes and two 5.7 routes, all trad - it sounded perfect for me.  No one had been there before so we started along the loop trail for one of the longer approaches at the bluffs.  It was the girls' turn to rope gun so we all took turns putting up the routes.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Call it a Day, great place to get some easier trad leads in</span>

			<p>
			<p>
			I started on the far left again on Chopper Malone (5.6) with Sara to my right heading up Clean Streak (5.6).  The climbing was decent, the cracks took a little work to find gear but not too bad.  I got to the top without any issues and lowered down for Aaron to clean it.  Next Sara and I swapped routes and I headed up Clean Streak (5.6).  It was a little more fun with a more straightforward crack for gear placement.  We both hit the 'crux' of the climbs near each other, so we shared how we got past them and continued to the top.

			Aubrey had led the two 5.7's on the right side so we switched.  The 5.7's shared a start, so I jumped on Buster (5.7) while Sara took a quick break.  It was a pretty straight forward climb with a fun finger crack at the top.  It took mostly bigger gear, but I slotted a nut in the finger crack before topping out at the anchor.  Aaron figured we could do an alternate start to Pee Wee (5.7) so we didn't have to share the start.  As Sara led Buster (5.7) I went up the alternate start.  I placed a #0.4 and after a few moves, made it to the nice ledge to rejoin the route.  Pee Wee is probably easier than a 5.7, but it was still nice to get another trad lead under my belt.  The third 5.6 headed up the middle of the crag and didn't look that fun so we called it done after all of us had led the four routes.  It was exactly what I was hoping for, a few easier trad leads to get back on the rock and brush off my gear placement before hopefully heading out on an alpine climb the following weekend.

I think it made the climb more fun</span>

			<p>
			<p>
			As we headed down the trail, we found Nubile Woman open.  Luke wanted to lead it so he got ready as Matt and Sara headed down to 2nd Avenue to climb some of the routes down there.  Aaron made me new tape gloves as Luke led Nubile Woman (5.10a).  After Aubrey cleaned it, I top roped it.  It was a really fun finger crack with some tricky moves.  We laughed that I had these nice new tape gloves for a finger crack, but I did find a few hand jams on the way up.  Luke top roped the face climb to the left of it, and then Sara climbed and cleaned Nubile Woman.  We packed up after that and headed for the cars.  I was just starting to feel my shoulder and Aaron was ready to head home, so it was good timing.  It was a great weekend.  We got to celebrate Ben and Chris's union, and I got out for my first cragging weekend of the season filled with some easy leads, just what I was hoping for.  Now to find some good weather and get back out in the alpine for some fun climbing.
