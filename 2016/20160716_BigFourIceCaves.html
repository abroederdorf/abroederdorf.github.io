			<h1>Big Four Ice Caves 7.16.16</h1>
			
			<p>
			My Mom was in town visiting and requested some time in the mountains during her trip. We planned to spend the weekend doing a hike each day somewhere in the North Cascades. Of course the weather had other intentions with rain on Saturday and possible thunderstorms on Sunday. We decided to cancel the original plans and instead find a day hike for Saturday. Big Four Ice Caves seemed like a good option and only had a 15% chance of rain so we headed there. We left Seattle about 7:30a and grabbed breakfast in Lake Stevens along the way.
			</p>

			It started sprinkling as we drove along the mountain loop highway which I didn’t expect. It was very cloudy but I was hoping to avoid the rain. We pulled into the trailhead parking lot for Big Four Ice Caves and I was impressed by how big it was, having to remember how popular the hike is. Luckily there were maybe 10 cars total if that so it wouldn’t be too crowded for us. The one advantage of the bad weather? We started out on the main trail from the parking lot. The first part of the trail was paved, which then led to sections of boardwalk to keep us above the marshland created by the local beavers. We soon came to the fork in the trail and took a left to continue towards the cave.

			Before long we arrived at the large metal bridge spanning the South Fork Stillaguamish. It is always interesting to compare how large the river basin is compared to the actual water running through it. I can’t imagine the times that the river swells so much to fill that entire space. The water was noticeably clear and there was a small water fall draining into the river.

			Turns out we’d follow the creek feeding that waterfall up to the ice cave, crossing it a couple more times. It had been sprinkling the entire time we were on the trail, not too much, but enough we got our rain jackets out.

			We continued making our way along the trail through all of the very green scenery consisting of trees, moss, and ferns. There were several downed trees but all were cut and off the trail, the trail was certainly well maintained. We spotted bunches of red berries along the trail and before long, reached the avalanche area warning signs. Immediately the telltale signs of down trees pointing in the direction of the fall line were noticed, as more evidence that the sign really was speaking the truth.

			We popped out of the trees here and into the meadow. Unfortunately the clouds were hanging really low and obscuring our views of the surrounding mountains, you could just make out gray blobs in some directions.
			</p>
			<p>
			We followed the rest of the trail through the meadow, getting our first glimpse of the ice cave at the base of Big Four Mountain. We followed the trail to the end and admired the view from there. Several more groups arrived shortly after us and I learned how the cave was during their previous trips. A few people ventured down on the rocks for a closer look but no one went too close. It was interesting to see the size difference between a person and the cave opening.

			I really wish we could have seen Big Four Mountain rising above the ice cave but the clouds were really low. After a quick snack we started our hike back to the car.

			When we hit the fork in the trail we stayed left to do the loop through the picnic area. The trail leading that way had boardwalks crossing larger bodies of water, the marsh really showing off. We saw the old chimney still standing from the lodge that used to be at the picnic area, then found the trail back to the trailhead parking lot. Along this paved trail there were tons of black slugs, we really had to keep an eye out to keep from stepping on them!
