			<h1>Guye Peak via Commonwealth Basin 7.3.16</h1>
			
			<p>
			I was able to get my homework done early and was looking forward to the long Fourth of July weekend to get out in the mountains and play a bit. I had a work event Saturday evening so I wanted to go camp in Gothic Basin Sunday/Monday, but of course the weather forecast had other ideas. In hopes that it would get better I didn’t do a lot of other research into potential trip plans, so in the end we decided to head up Guye Peak. It’s about 2000’ of elevation gain and maybe 6 miles so it seemed to be within my current fitness abilities and we had done it several times before. The key was we’ve always climbed it in the winter, but we figured there would be a summer trail up from the Commonwealth Basin too – we just didn’t do any research into it. We were also working on the house a bit so we picked Sunday morning for our hike with a forecast for 20% chance of rain to allow us to work on the house during a drier period of time. We figured 20% meant a pretty good chance of a dry hike though.
			</p>
			<p>
			We left the house a bit before 8am and arrived about 9am at the PCT trailhead at Snoqualmie Pass off of exit 52 along I-90. About Issaquah we hit light precipitation but I hoped it would end when we left North Bend – no such luck. The only thing Aaron hates more than hiking is hiking in the rain, but he knew I really wanted to get out in the mountains so we decided to put our rain jackets on and suck it up. The trailhead parking lot had maybe 10 cars in it when we arrived so plenty of close parking to be had – one upside of the weather? We registered at the trailhead and started in, taking the early left to head up the old Commonwealth Basin trail instead of connecting to the PCT. We always take the old trail as it’s not as long as the PCT, but as we’d later find out you have to take this trail if you plan to climb Guye Peak. The old trail eventually turns into the trail to Red Mountain and also intercepts the PCT which heads up towards Kendall Peak so it’s not required if those are the intended destinations.

			It was precipitating pretty good and we were glad to have the rain jackets on. A bit into the hike we stopped in a dry spot under some trees to ditch our long sleeves as we were heating up in our rain jackets. The first section of the old trail is really overgrown so you constantly brush up against the foliage on both sides of the trail, which made for a wet hike as all the water on the plant leaves found new homes on our pants. Luckily that overgrown section gives way to a trail that meanders through the trees. There were two new sections of trail cut that paralleled the old trail. They did a good job of covering the entry points of the old sections though so it was clear to follow the new parts.

			About a half hour in we reached the log crossing. On the other side the trail went both left and right. From our previous climbs – I’d climbed Guye Peak 4 times and Aaron 6 times – we knew we wanted to hit the saddle between Guye Peak and Cave Ridge, we just needed to find a trail that took us there. Being that we usually head a bit north before heading up to the saddle we took the trail to the right and began looking for some sort of trail breaking off to the left to take us to the saddle.

				<span class="caption">Log crossing</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			After the log crossing there were a lot of downed trees along the trail. We’d come across faint paths and head off hoping it was the trail we were looking for, just to end up bushwhacking through the wet foliage and eventually finding our way back to the main trail. We kept going, thinking maybe the trail cut over farther up in the basin for whatever reason. We had lots of creek crossings to navigate and the water level was decently high. Over the one large water area I put my right foot in the water on the way across.

			<p>
			We finished meandering through the basin, trying to follow anything that looked like a trail only to hit dead ends. As the trail started to gain elevation up towards Red Mountain we decided to turn around – we figured we could go start work on the house since we clearly weren’t climbing Guye Peak. I ate my candy bar for the day and we took a selfie in the trees since we wouldn’t get a summit selfie. Aaron dunked his foot on the way back across the large water area, and I fell in up to my left knee on another creek crossing so my boots were thoroughly wet at this point.

				<span class="caption">Basin selfie</span>

			<p>
			Finding it hard to believe we couldn’t find a trail to Guye Peak we decided to continue on the trail past the log crossing, what would initially have had us taking a left. Aaron was ahead so he checked it out as I reached the log. As I followed him across another creek he asked if I still wanted to climb Guye Peak – we had finally found the trail after a 2.5 mile tour through the basin. I had already switched my mindset to heading home as we were a half hour from the car. I didn’t verbally reply yes but I started following the new trail we found. This one is certainly a climbers’ trail so it was narrow and not as well defined. There were several trees down along this trail as well so we’d have to pause every so often to find the trail continuing after we walked along a log or on the other side of what appeared to be a tree massacre. The climbers’ trail also provided lots of opportunity to brush water off the foliage lining the narrow trail, ensuring that our pants were always wet.

			Before long we were heading up the ridge on the very efficient (i.e. steep) climbers’ trail. The trail was pretty easy to follow through the trees, and there were a couple of small sections that followed rocks up.
			</p>

				<a class="example-image-link" href="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7098/28085859116_6595adc78d_h.jpg" data-lightbox="allPics" data-title="Trail went up this rock face, luckily it had built in steps"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7098/28085859116_f676b2c1f2.jpg" alt="Trail went up this rock face, luckily it had built in steps"/></a>		   
				<br>
				<span class="caption">Trail went up this rock face, luckily it had built in steps</span>

			<p>
			We hit the first small boulder field and followed the cairn through it, then we hit the second larger boulder field. There were two cairns near the bottom that we followed but not seeing where the trail went we headed up the boulder field. Boulder hopping is pretty typical on climbs so we didn’t question it and probably didn’t spend enough time trying to find a real trail. As we got to the top of the boulder field we didn’t see a trail so we bushwhacked in the general direction of the saddle. After a bit of this we finally spotted what looked to be a climbers’ trail a little downhill from us, so we went down to it thankful to end the bushwhacking. It was indeed the trail we had lost before!

			We continued along it until we hit another area with a downed tree. It was at the base of a large, left facing rock face with a patch of snow along the base. I thought I saw what looked like a trail high above, assuming it would take us above the rock face. After some discussion and exploring other possible directions, we decided that was our best option. We headed up along the rocks and followed the path – we guessed correctly!

			<p>
			A bit more gain above the rock face brought us to the saddle. From the saddle we had just over 400’ to the summit. Aaron checked that I wanted to continue – I was a bit more tired than him but my foot has also been hurting. I said that I probably shouldn’t because of my foot but of course I wanted to continue so off we went, taking the trail to our left (heading south) to climb the ridge to Guye Peak. The trail straight ahead (heading west) leads to Snoqualmie Mountain, and the trail to the right (heading north) heads up Cave Ridge.

			<p>
			We came upon a pond which I never realized was there. I remembered the big flat area of snow but never made the connection that it was there because of a pond. After the pond the trail started up in a very efficient manner, but there was a trail we were able to follow which was nice. There were a few small slabs to scramble up along the way which made the ascent a little more fun.

			<p>
			Finally we reached the flatter bench area just below the summit, and much to our surprise we saw three people on the north summit. We hadn’t seen anyone on the trail up, and only two groups in the basin on our extended tour, so we were surprised. Turns out they had already climbed Snoqualmie Mountain that morning and had come up from the Alpental side.

			It was a little windy on top but at least it helped dry our pants. The clouds were still sitting low so we had limited views of the surrounding area, but of course I still took a few pictures. We found a good spot to sit and enjoy our snacks while our feet dangled over the edge. We didn’t sit too long so we could get out of the wind and actually head home.

			Back at the saddle Aaron had me lead down, saying that I was better at trail sleuthing – I really don’t believe that but I got to set the pace being out front. We built a little cairn at the bottom of the large rock face, hopefully signaling to others that the trail continued that way. We followed the trail down the entire time, discovering where we had lost it at the second, larger boulder field. It actually continued climber’s right along the bottom and then up through the trees, not up the boulder field itself. We built two cairns to hopefully help guide future hikers in the right direction.

			After that it was a matter of following the trail back down into the basin, navigating one last creek crossing before running across the well-established log crossing. Another half hour or so out on the trail and we made it to the car! We had some navigation shenanigans that probably could have been avoided if we did a little research, but now at least I know how to follow the trail up to Guye Peak. Even though the weather wasn’t great and we took the scenic route through the basin, is was still really nice to get out in the mountains with Aaron. After a stop at Dairy Queen for some ice cream on the way home, we still had time to get a couple coats of stain on the house to beat the rain in the forecast the next day.
			</p>
			<h4>Route Synopsis</h4>
			<p>
			From the PCT trailhead, take the old Commonwealth Basin trail on the left (trail that seems a bit overgrown). Follow this trail to the big creek and cross at the established log footbridge. On the other side of the trail take a left, then keep right after the next smaller creek crossing. Pay close attention to follow this trail over tree blow downs through the basin, then start heading up the ridge. As you ascend the ridge you’ll trend slightly climber's right, aiming for the saddle. At the large boulder field (4100’) keep climber's right along the base of it – do not ascend the boulders! At the large, left facing rock face (4400’) head climber's left up the faint trail. This brings you to the saddle (4600’). From the saddle take the trail on the left (heading south) to ascend the final ridge to the north summit of Guye Peak.
