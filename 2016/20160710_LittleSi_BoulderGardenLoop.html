			<h1>Little Si & Boulder Garden Loop 7.10.16</h1>
			
			<p>
			I was able to get enough school done again that I got a weekend day to play. Despite the fact that it’s after July fourth which means it should be sunny in Seattle, the forecast was showing a 60-70% chance of rain in the mountains. This would be my first solo hike in quite a while and adding in the rain, I decided to stay close to home. I was thinking Tiger Mountain but then decided on Little Si instead. I haven’t done that hike since 2009 and I found an additional loop, the Boulder Garden Loop, which would add another 1.5 miles and about 500’ of gain to the normal Little Si hike. I finally stopped snoozing my 7am alarm about 7:30am and hit the road at 7:50am.

			I pulled into the overflow lot at Little Si about 8:30am and was the first car - only because the main lot had just filled up. I put on my shoes, grabbed my pack, and started down the trail that connects the two parking lots. It was surprisingly not raining yet so my coat was still in my pack, however, I decided I’d just hike in my rain pants the entire time. I finally got a chance to use my new rain pants, yay? As I reached the main lot the last parking spot was taken. About 0.3 miles in I hit the fork for the Boulder Garden Loop trail and I took it, heading right. I decided I wanted to do the extra loop on the way up rather than adding it on my way down.

			The trail was pretty quiet, I met maybe 3 people total on it? It wound through the trees mostly, everything was either brown or green. I did happen to find a little stand of white flowers along the trail that really stood out. Otherwise I admired the green, the large boulders I passed, and lots of spider webs.

			I passed the trail fork to Mt Si and continued left on the loop trail. The rain was still holding off for the time being and I hit the high point, started my journey down to rejoin the Little Si Trail. I think the trail down was a bit steeper and rockier than the way I came up. Before I knew it I was back on the main trail.

			A bit more up along the trail soon brought me to the large bench. It just started raining too. It was interesting because at first I could hear the rain but didn’t feel anything, but of course before long I felt the rain too. I paused to get my jacket out and decided to see if it would fit over my pack, in hopes of keeping my pack a little drier. It sort of did if I didn’t zip it up so instead I used a few of the Velcro bits to help keep it somewhat closed. I also remembered to bring my OR hat which was instrumental in keeping the rain out of my face.

			I met a few groups heading down as I went up. The trail was of course muddy but that’s to be expected given the rain. There was one pair of guys that seemed to be hiking at my pace and talking incessantly and loudly. I get that on a popular trail like Little Si I should expect to see lots of people, but generally they aren’t hiking at the same pace as you just 50 feet back so the conversations eventually pass. I finally had enough and let the guys pass me and waited a bit, to let them get out of ear shot and then continued on.

			Before too long I got the peekaboo view of Mt Si and the Haystack as the clouds were blowing in, and could tell I was essentially at the summit. I made the summit about 1 hour and 45 minutes after I left the car. I found two of the geo markers, took a couple pictures, and headed down as the chatty guys stayed at the top.

			I was surprised at how many people I met on the way down, considering it was raining - and not the light rain. Lots of families and kids, but glad to see everyone out trying to enjoy the mountains. I tried to head down at a pretty good pace and made it back to the car about 2 hours and 40 minutes after I started. I definitely brought a happy bag and changed into dry pants and a shirt before driving home, which was only slightly awkward as a car sat waiting for my spot. Both lots were completely full and there were several cars hoping for hikers to appear after finishing their adventures. I made it home at noon, so overall not too much of my day got taken up. Of course the sunshine is out in Seattle, because that’s how it works. Overall it was still nice to get out in the mountains despite the weather, and to re-visit an old trail.
