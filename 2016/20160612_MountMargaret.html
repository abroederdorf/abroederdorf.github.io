			<h1>Mount Margaret 6.12.16</h1>
			
			<p>
			I finished my spring quarter and was looking forward to playing in the mountains over my one free weekend before the summer quarter started. Of course the weather didn’t want to fully cooperate so we stayed in town on Saturday and went to the climbing gym, then went for a hike on Sunday. I found a new hike for Aaron and me, Mount Margaret. There are official WTA hikes from the guide books to Lake Lillian and Twin Lakes, or Margaret Lake, but I figured Aaron would be more interesting in summiting the peak. Our initial plan was to take the trail towards Lake Lillian, then cut up off the trail somewhere to gain the ridge and head to the summit. Depending on how we felt, we’d finish the mile and a half hike to the lake or just head home. We left home about 8:10a, stopped in North Bend for some gas and breakfast, and made it to the trailhead off of exit 54 about 9:45a. After some sunscreen and getting gear in order, we were ready to hit the trail.

			I had read several trip reports and put together a little beta sheet for following the trail up since we wouldn’t be following an official trail the whole way. Also, the most recent trip reports to either of the lakes were from two weeks prior and mentioned that there was still snow. I brought a map too so we could navigate if we hit a bunch of snow – I didn’t know what to expect. It may have been overkill for our hike but it was nice to go through the motions again since I haven’t gotten to trip plan for a long time. We hiked back out of the parking lot to the road, took a left, and started hiking up. After a bit we veered left again and continued following a road up. After about a mile or so, we found the trail split complete with signs directing us to the left to head towards Lake Lillian and Margaret Lake.

			A little over a quarter mile along this trail brought us to a road crossing, complete with a path bordered with rocks – apparently some hikers were really bored? After crossing the road we followed the trail up through the more open section filled with grasses, bushes, and smaller trees. We started getting our first views too. It was a gorgeous day! We somehow lucked out and started hiking under blue skies and sunshine. Eventually we entered the old growth forest again, probably around 4800’. We also started encountering the first small patches of snow, hitting larger and more regular patches around 5000’.

			The trail switch backed through this section and was a bit more difficult to follow as it wasn’t as defined. There isn’t a lot of undergrowth in the old growth forest section so it was trying to find the mud/dirt that looked more trodden that the surrounding mud/dirt, opposed to a well-defined path bordered with vegetation. Add in some snow and we paused several times to scan our surroundings to find either the footprints through the snow, or the next section of trail that was melted out. We caught up to some other hikers so we ended up leading the way as they were finding the same difficulties with navigation. After travelling across significantly large snow sections, we found the sign signifying the fork in the trail.

			We continued left, following the bootpack through the snow towards Lake Lillian. I got out the map so we could talk about our plan for gaining the ridge. We decided it’d be best to head up at the saddle, then follow the ridge up to the summit. I checked my GPS to get a better idea of where we were in comparison to these features, and we started blazing our own trail across the snow in an effort to avoid losing any elevation along the trail. We found some moss covered rocks and headed up from the snow. We bushwhacked a bit through the trees, then picked up the climber’s path to the summit.

			The path comes up the eastside of the summit and we were greeted with some fantastic views. We could see most of Mount Rainier through the clouds and we found the top of a distant Mount Adams. We could see Mount Margaret below us to the east, and then to the north-northwest we found Twin Lakes, Laura Lake, and Lake Lillian along with some huge waterfalls cascading down from Laura Lake and Lake Lillian. Twin Lakes were pretty small and Lake Lillian seemed mostly covered in ice and snow still. We were surprised at how steep the valley to the lake looked, it seemed like more elevation gain than we were expecting. We ate some snacks and I took photos while we enjoyed our rocky seats at the top. There were some steep drop offs from the top which was unexpected. In the end, from our vantage point we could see the lakes really well. I didn’t think I would gain much by actually being at the lake so we decided to head home instead of continuing on the hike. Maybe some time in the future I’ll do the hike all the way to the lakes.

			The climber’s trail was very efficient, i.e. steep and I fell a couple times. The first time was on the dirt trail, there were lots of little pinecones and it was a bit wet. The second time was on one of the snow patches. I fell and glissaded a bit. Aaron came to help me up but instead I just glissaded the rest of the way down the slope until I was stopped in the slide alder. We descended back to the boot pack trail through the snow and started down, without too much difficulty, following the trail back down. Luckily I didn’t fall anymore. We met several groups on their way up, one looking a little lost in the old growth forest section as well. Probably another month or so and hopefully the snow is all gone to make the hike a bit more straightforward for everyone. It was a great little hike complete with summit, and some great views – certainly better than some of the other I-90 hikes I’ve made Aaron go on with me.
