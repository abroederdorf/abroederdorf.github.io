			<h1>Exit 38: Write-Off Rock at Deception Crag 6.19.16</h1>
			
			Alyssa was in town but unfortuately the weather wasn't really cooperating for a grand adventure. Instead we opted to head to Exit 38 for a little cragging. We hot a relaxed start on Sunday and grabbed lunch on the way. Alyssa needed to be at the airport by 4pm for her flight home so we didn't have a ton of time. Since it had rained a bit recently we decided to just go to the popular Write-Off Rock at Deception Crag at the top of the trail to the train trestle.

			Danielle got first honors by leading <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/bottoms-up/106241707">Bottoms Up</a> (5.7) on the far right side of the crag. It was a beautiful day and fortunately the crag wasn't too busy while we were there. Danielle diligently made her way up the route. I climbed it next and cleaned it.

			Next Alyssa led <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/knife-in-the-toaster/106002147">Knife in the Toaster</a> (5.9) in the middle of the crag. She made it through the moves downlow which take some concentration with the smooth, downward sloping rock. She ran across the middle level portion before take a quick breath before heading up the last wall - the crux. She stayed right as she went up and with a final heel hook, pulled over the top to reach the anchor.

			Next I belayed Danielle as she climbed a Knife in the Toaster. Aaron had scrambled up along with Alyssa to clean to the route so we could hit the road to the airport. Although a quick day it was nice to get outside and spend a bit of time with Alyssa during her visit!
