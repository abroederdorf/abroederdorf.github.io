			<h1>Blue Lake & Lone Fir 8.20.16</h1>
			
			<p>
			Aaron’s friend Dan was in town so we were trying to figure out a mountain adventure. Unfortunately his trip coincided with some record high temperatures in Seattle which complicated planning since I don’t like hiking in the heat – mostly because my body does not react well to the heat. Aaron offered up lots of ideas for backpacking trips, but I was the biggest constraint since I’m a bit out of shape thanks to the work/school combo. We narrowed down the options to two thanks to some construction on I-5 southbound. Option 1 was to hike up to base camp on Mount Baker and hang out up there enjoying the views. Option 2 was to car camp near WA pass and do a day hike each day. Presenting these to Dan Friday night we finally decided on option 2 – yay for not carrying camping gear in ridiculous heat. We picked the short hike to Blue Lake for Saturday since it was the hottest day, and then a longer hike to Cascade Pass on Sunday. Friday night was spent picking up some new hiking shoes for both of the guys at REI before catching up with other Seattle friends.

			Saturday we woke up about 7am, packed, and loaded up the car. Our plan was to stop along the drive to check out a few sights, grab a camp site, and then do our short hike. We stopped for some breakfast and to get a few last minute items at the store before exiting for 530 to head up to highway 20. We stopped first at the gorge overlook to check out the dam and the waterfall nearby. Next we stopped at the Diablo Lake overlook to take in the gorgeous views of both the turquoise lake and surrounding mountains. After that we went straight to the Lone Fir campground after noting how many cars were parked on the road near the Blue Lake Trailhead. We found an open campsite right away and were surprised there were several open still. After setting up our tents we drove back up to the trailhead and got ready. Double bonus of not hiking for too long in the ridiculous heat was a shorter hike for the guys to figure out their new shoes and find any hot spots.

			We hit the trail and started up, with me lagging behind. Luckily most of the trail is in the trees so the shade provided some relief. We met several groups along the trail as expected, and soon made it to the climber’s trail fork. This area offers the first good views of nearby rocky peaks too so we took a minute so I could take pictures while Aaron talked about some of the climbs in the Liberty Bell group looming overhead. This would be the first time in seven years that I didn’t take that climber’s trail but rather continued to the lake. A bit more of a traverse and before long we were at the lake.

			There were a few hikers already swimming or playing in the water. The lake is nestled at the base of rock faces and surrounded by trees on the other sides. Aaron tested the water but ultimately decided not to go for a swim. We took a few pictures, then followed a boot pack up a nearby hill overlooking the lake hoping we’d get some better views of the Liberty Bell group. We were not disappointed and I took a few more pictures.

			Unfortunately I got sunscreen in my left eye so it was stinging/watering pretty good. Part way back on the traverse I had Aaron try to flush it with some water – try because I don’t handle eye things well and have a hard time letting anyone put anything in my eyes. It did help and soon I was moving back down the trail at a more normal pace. We met several more groups on the way out and after counting all of the wooden walkways (for some reason I thought there were three when I counted earlier – turns out there are 8), we made it back to the parking lot. I had managed to get the last of the sunscreen out of my eye too and it no longer stinged – win! We stopped at the Washington Pass overlook on our way back to camp to enjoy the views on that side and the cool breeze.

			I had also picked up a little backpacking bocce ball set on impulse as we walked to the register at REI Friday night, so after our hike we hung out at camp and played some bocce ball before heading into Winthrop for some early dinner. Some delicious Mexican food in A/C left us full and happy so we headed back to camp. As it was still early and the guys wanted to walk off some of their dinner, we decided to hike the little campground trail. Aaron and I had done it in 2011 just after a storm so there were some bridges still in progress. We were interested to see what changes had been made. The guys decided to change from their flip flops back into their hiking shoes but I mistakenly stuck with my keens.

			We started down the trail and took a left at the fork. The first bridge we came to looked great, the last time it had only been the one foot log across and it hadn’t even been chipped into the even walking surface yet. Soon we came to a very battered boardwalk and then started encountering the downed trees. Most of the boardwalks were in sketchy condition and I’d guess we had to climb over or under a good 20 downed trees – it was much more of an adventure than we expected!

			We came to the second bridge to cross back over the creek. This one had not changed since our last trip, still missing the cable for the railing. Some more half rotted boardwalks and many more downed trees finally got us back on the paved trail and heading to the campsite. Overall a successful day 1 as we fell asleep under a surprisingly bright moon.
