			<h1>Poo Poo Point 4.23.16</h1>

			<p>
			Sara wanted to take a quick break and get out in the mountains and I wanted to avoid the project I was working on for school, so we settled on a close hike that wouldn't be too long - Poo Poo Point. Sara had done it before but I had only done part of the trail back in 2009. I was recovering from the flu at the time so I turned around part way up. The forecast for Saturday was so-so, with rain predicted ending around nine and starting again around noon. Trying to hit the weather window and also wanting to get back to get some studying done, we opted to leave about 8am. We followed the directions in my day hiking book to the Issaquah high school. After a bit of driving around we found a parking lot at the school with what appeared to be other hikers just leaving. We grabbed our stuff and started up the stairs from the parking lot.
			</p>
			<p>
			I hadn't read the trail description so we started out and turned at the trail sign - our first mistake. We started up, stopping a couple times to go back the other way at forks we encountered, and eventually realized we weren't on the right trail. Sara had pulled up the description online on her phone and read that we shouldn't have taken any side trails.

			We followed our trail back, eventually making a loop out of it and started losing elevation as we made our way toward the old road, the trail we were supposed to be on. Once on that, Sara prevented me from taking more side trails and we eventually found a sign for the Poo Poo Point trail we were seeking. Apparently our navigation skills are a bit rusty as neither of us have gotten to use them much in the past year? Worst case we figured we'd end up back at the car and adventure to the yogurt place Sara spotted in town instead.

			Once we were on the trail it was easy to follow, fairly decent too - not too rocky or muddy. There were groups of people that we passed heading down but overall it wasn't overly busy for being a popular hike close to town. We chatted, or rather I talked - apparently I need to take more breaks from studying and my computer and socialize a bit more, so before I knew it we were nearing the top.

			After dropping down in elevation again, we were worried we had missed a turn but we continued along the flat trail and found ourselves at the point. It was just starting to sprinkle so I took a few pictures and then we found an open bench covered by some trees for a summit snack. It was cloudy but luckily we still had a pretty good view of Lake Samamish, Issaquah, and a distant Bellevue. The view was better than I expected, and the little launch pad for paragliders was neat to see. There were lots of little hiking groups spread around, enjoying the reward for their hard work.

			Before getting too cold, we started back along the trail. The steep section we had descended near the end didn't seem as bad as either of us expected heading back up it. The rest of the hike down went smoothly. It rained intermittently but the trees mostly covered us. At one point it picked up and wanting to avoid being soaked by time we got back to the cars, we stopped quick to throw our rain jackets on. Not long after the rain had stopped and the sun was actually out, not what we expected! We followed the main trail all the way back down, passing the fork we had taken to find it. We discovered our initial wrong turn and made our way back to the car. I mean we just wanted to extend the hike a little bit and enjoy some more time in the mountains, it was our plan all along.
