			<h1>Granite Mountain 8.21.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			I had a Sunday with no plans and a good weather forecast – a rare thing indeed.  I decided to go for a hike, something I hadn't done since the spring.  I didn't want to go too far away so I set my eyes on the I-90 corridor and narrowed it down to Granite Mountain, Kendall Peak, or Bandera.  After some reading I went with my initial thought and decided on <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/granite-mountain-1%E2%80%9D">Granite Mountain</a>.  It's a popular hike that I'd never done.  It has some decent elevation gain and a scramble at the top to a fire lookout with some great views.  I had planned to leave about 8AM but didn't get out my door until close to 9AM.  Unfortunately that put me more in the heat of the day.  I arrived at the trailhead, put my pass out, put my shoes on, slathered on some sunscreen, grabbed my pack, and started my tunes.  There were a couple of hikers not far from me on the trail but I got some good space to myself.</p>

			The trail winds its way through the trees, forking off from the Pratt Lake trail not far into the hike.  Soon I started weaving in and out from the edge of the trees.</p>

			I got my first glimpses of some mountains across I-90 – I believe Silver Peak being one of them.  It was hot and I stopped along the trail to zip off the bottoms of my pants.  I brought two liters of water and was glad I did.  I got some Gu and slowly made my way up the trail, trying to fight off the incessant bug attacks.  I started finding more people as I went, most all upholding the kind hiker community image.  Soon I crossed the avalanche gully and continued on the summer trail into the meadows.  I had even better views of the mountains along the south side of the I-90 corridor and enjoyed seeing all of the pretty wildflowers in bloom – so many colors!</p>

			The trail firsts traverses quite far across the meadow below the peak, then starts working its way back and up to the peak with little switchbacks.  There were several forks throughout the meadow so it was interesting picking my way up.</p>

			I had hoped to do the scramble up but kept following the trail so I missed gaining the ridge on its east end.  The trail got a lot more wet with water running down it.  I had been thinking this might be my first time in the mountains without any snow this year but I was wrong.  There was plenty just below the summit on the north side of the mountain.  I crossed several patches of snow and was soon regretting even more forgetting my trekking poles at home.  I followed the boot pack across the snow, turned a corner, and was delighted to see the lookout tower right in front of me.  The summit was fairly busy with lots of small groups lounging in the sun on the rocks, enjoying some lunch and snacks.  I went up the stairs to the deck on the lookout tower.  A ranger was up there so the tower was well stocked with things for someone to stay.  I made my way around the deck, taking pictures, and grabbing a quick bite.  It was a bit breezy which made it cool compared to the hot, sunny weather I'd been hiking in all day.</p>

			I checked out the path/scramble down the ridge and decided to go down that way.  I didn't want to deal with the snow on the way down anyways.  Scrambling made the going a little slow but fun – I had to have some rock fun for the day.  I picked my way among the rocks and finally found myself back in the meadow with a whole trail system that I had somehow missed.  After a bit it finally joined up with the trail I took up.  It was early afternoon and I decided it was time to get back so I started off at a brisk pace, snacking on some Skittles as I went.  When I was back on the long traverse through the meadow, I decided to start mixing in a little jogging to speed up my descent.  My GPS was flashing low battery so I was hoping to make it back in time – I still had about a mile left.  I somehow kept up a good pace and soon found myself back at the car, happy to be heading home.  It was nice to get out for a day of hiking.  I had my music, a little time to myself, and some beautiful mountains and wildflower views to enjoy.</p>
