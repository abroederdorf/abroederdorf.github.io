			<h1>Eagle Chutla Saddle 1.2.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			There were still a couple days before work started for most of us, so a group decided to head down to Mt Rainier and do some backcountry skiing from Camp Muir.  Since I do not posses the necessary backcountry skiing skills, I opted to go along and snowshoe instead with <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13228">Lina and Tracy</a>.  We left Seattle at 5AM and headed for the mountain.  When we arrived a Longmire around 7AM, we were told the park was going to plow the road and it would be 8:30AM before the gate was open.  When the gate finally did open a ranger stood nearby ensuring that all 4WD vehicles had chains and that all 2WD vehicles already had chains on - our group only had one set of chains for 3 cars.  Plan B was quickly formulated and instead we geared up to head up into the Tatoosh range, towards Eagle and Chutla which just happened to be my Tatoosh climb for BCC.  Fortunately, Sunday was clear out so we could actually see the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13212">mountains</a>!
			</p>
			<p>
			There was a fairly decent boot pack so most of the group started hiking in.  I've finally learned how to go at my own pace and not kill myself so the hike was very enjoyable and I had enough air to chat along the way.  We finally got to a point when all the skiers put on their skis and started skinning up along the trail.  Us snowshoers took about 10 steps, post-holing through half of them, before deciding it was time to put our snowshoes on as well.  I was borrowing Niki's for the day which have the cool ascender bars - although I didn't use those until later since the trail wasn't very steep.  The snowshoers kept close, staying at the Alicia pace.  It was like walking through a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13226">winter wonderland</a>, everything was covered in snow and it was beautiful.  After while the sun starting poking through the trees, unfortunately warming things up so the trees kept dropping snow on us.
			</p>
			<p>
			We caught up to the skiers just before going up the first open <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13221">slope</a> as they were taking a break and grabbing some food.  Since we were finally breaking out of the trees, I applied some sun screen.  The skiers started up, and soon after, the snowshoers took off as well, following their tracks traversing across the slope.  We were treated to our first views of the mountains south of the Tatoosh - <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13211">Mt St Helens</a> was out.  Sara, new to skiing and brand new to backcountry skiing, was trying to figure everything out while the guys took off.  All the snowshoers were snowshoeing because we don't know how to backcountry ski and unfortunately, couldn't offer any help.  While Lina and Tracy stayed behind to make sure no one was left on their own, I started after the guys to find some more experienced help.  After hiking up through the trees, using the ascenders, I finally spotted the guys crossing the last open <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13213">slope</a> to the saddle and yelled to them.  Surprisingly they heard me and not too long later, Matt came ripping by me on his way back to Sara.
			</p>
			<p>
			I continued along the boy's tracks, keeping Lindsey in my sights.  She was also snowshoeing but with her skis and boots on her back for use on the way back down.  As I reached the saddle I found the group enjoying a lunch <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13206">break</a>.  I got right to work with my camera capturing the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13207">views</a> of the volcanoes to the south, Mt Rainier to the north, and the general <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13216"> beauty</a> of all the snow covered trees and peaks.  Cody brewed up some hot chocolate, Nate fought the birds, and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13208">Luke</a> and Aaron N went for a walk for better views.  After grabbing a quick snack, it was almost time to head back down.  The snowshoers were going to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13190">glissade</a> down the open slopes the skiers would be skiing down, so I put on my new rain pants and my shell, packed all my loose items into my bag, and collapsed my trekking poles.  I started down, mostly creating my own glissade chute, partially using the boot tracks up.  It was a lot of fun as always.  At the bottom of the first slope, we watched <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13204">Cody</a>, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13196">Aaron P</a>, and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13179">Sara</a> do some skiing before being ushered along so we could keep up with the group.  Lina and I took off and after falling all over in the snow and becoming super frustrated, we put our snowshoes back on for the short trek to the next slope where we took them off to glissade again.
			</p>
			<p>
			The second slope wasn't nearly as fun to glissade down, but after inching our way along, we made it down to most of the skiers waiting for everyone.  We put our snowshoes on again and took off down the trail to meet up with everyone back at the cars.  We really didn't know where the group would be skiing down and were convinced they'd be waiting for us, tapping their toes, at the cars.  We kept up a good pace and felt indestructible in our showshoes on the way down.  Before we knew it we were back on the road, crossing the bridge, and back at the cars.  We packed our stuff up, donned some more layers, and waited about 30 minutes for the rest of the crew to show up.  It was a great day and it felt really good to be back in the mountains, sort of climbing.  It was really nice to see where we were suppose to climb in BCC too, and get some of the awesome views we missed.  Overall, a great first hike for 2011!</p>
