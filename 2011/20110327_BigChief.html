			<h1>Big Chief 3.27.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			We finally got our teams this past Wednesday at class.  I knew the instructors I would be working with as we had found that out the previous week, but there was much excitement about getting students.  My outings are on Sundays again and I'm with <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13772">Team 7</a> this year...name to be decided still.  The first team outing for the class is to Big Chief right by Stevens Pass to learn snow skills including <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13846">kicking steps</a>, traveling with an <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13838">ice axe</a>, crossing an avalanche gully, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13810">self arresting</a> with an ice axe, building <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13781">snow anchors</a>, snow belays, rope travel, and plunge stepping.  We met at the Green Lake park and ride at 4:00 AM and arrived in the parking lot by 5:45 AM - a bit early.  After pulling out the helmet decorations (Sara's <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13844">flowers</a> and my dinosaur - Sprinkles the Stegosaurus as named by Curtis) we couldn't quite nap due to the non-stop laughter in the car.  Around 6:20 AM we got out of our warm car finally and geared up.  After inspecting ice axes and gaiters, Curtis started out the morning by talking about the proper ways to hold an ice axe.  We crossed the busy highway 2 and made it to the upper parking lot where <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13847">Robert</a> gave a demonstration of kicking steps in the snow.  After a little practice it was time to climb Big Chief.
			</p>
			<p>
			The team did a great job of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13841">kicking steps</a> while getting used to the whole eating, drinking, and maintaining a good body temperature while constantly on the move.  They even pulled out their compasses to help navigate us east to the ridge for the rest of the skills.  The weather was actually really good when we started, some sunshine and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13850">blue skies</a> above.  I was surprised since I was expecting snow but it rolled in just before we reached the ridge.  After putting on another layer (yay ridiculously large bright orange puffy coat) we found our way to a spot for the majority of the skills.  We started with self arresting, everyone getting to practice the 4 positions having the ice axe head in both the left and right hand.  The students did a great job and I think they were having <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13804">fun</a> - I caught a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13818">smiles</a> as they sped past me.  Unfortunately <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13800">Thai</a> hurt his knee during one of his arrest attempts, but he was able to head back up towards our gear.  After self arrest practice we worked on <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13782">anchors</a>.  I got to talk about using a picket as a picket and I finally got to use my new pickets that I got for my birthday in December.  Saturday I went to REI to get a couple locking carabiners and some slings for them - I found the brightest yellow possible, the slings were glowing.  No worry about losing those!  After learning about using a picket, deadman, and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13778">bollard</a> as anchors Thai headed down early with Robert, Charlie, and Emily - a little extra time to get down with the bad knee.  After that we worked on belays - I talked about the boot axe belay while Samra covered the carabiner ice axe belay.
			</p>
			<p>
			After practicing the belays, it was time to rope up and head for the summit of Big Chief.  After a short walk along the ridge, we arrived at the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13776">summit</a>.  We spent just a few minutes sharing summit <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13775">treats</a> (brownies, powdered donettes, and a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13773">jumpin' jackrabbit marshmallow rope</a>) and taking <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13771">team</a> pictures before heading back to the saddle.  After putting harnesses away and taking a layer off, Ron demonstrated plunge stepping and down we went.  We apparently like going down the steepest way and found ourselves at the road a bit east of the parking lot.  We stayed atop the snow bank and made our way back to the parking lot for the debrief.  The students did a great job and we made good time on the day - back to the parking lot by 4:00 PM.  After huddle time and changing into some cotton clothing, we were headed to Ixtapa in Sultan for our traditional Mexican dinner/post climbing <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13769">feast</a>.  Some delicious cheesy enchiladas and rice hit the spot and we were on our way back home.  Overall a great day, lots of fun, and I think we have an awesome team.  I can't wait for more climbs!</p>
