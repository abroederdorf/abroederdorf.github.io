			<h1>The Tooth 7.23.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was time for a girls climbing weekend so Sara, Alicia, Lina, and I decided to take on The Tooth near Snoqualmie Pass.  I was ready for my second multi-pitch alpine climb and a close day climb sounded pretty good.  We read up on the trip, got beta, and prepared for a route full of late season snow thanks to our weather this year.  We met at Sara's at 6AM and headed for the pass.  We arrived, geared up, grabbed a wilderness permit at the trailhead, and were on the trail about 7:30 AM.  The first part of the trail is shared by people heading to Snow Lake and Source Lake (and the peaks nearby).  I had done the hike to Snow Lake and Gem Lake a couple years back and remembered the trail - this time I'd be continuing towards Source Lake though.  We crossed over several creeks and started encountering the first small patches of snow.  Nothing much and easy to cross.

			At the fork with the trail up to Snow Lake we stopped for a Gu break and happened to see some friendly faces hiking up behind us, also on their way to The Tooth.  We continued on and soon ran out of dirt trail, following the boot pack in the snow just up from Source Lake.  We looked around the bowl and spotted The Tooth, and our expected route.  I had programmed some waypoints into my GPS to help sort of guide us.  It's my new found trip planning - getting some waypoints with the help of Google Earth to put in my GPS.

			We followed the boot pack over a small boulder field.  Luckily for us it is a late snow season so that we didn't have to cross the boulder field in its entirety.

			We were soon heading up the gully.  It was a fairly steep gully with lots of snow.  The boot pack had some big steps so Lina decided to kick her own.

			It was a gorgeous day out and I was happy to be climbing in the mountains with friends.  After crossing over a narrow chunk of snow that was melting out, we grabbed out our ice axes - probably a half to two thirds of the way up the first gully.  The snow was hard but not enough to warrant donning the crampons we each carried with us - just consider them training weight.

			I had heard stories of people taking the wrong gully so after a while we started questioning our path.  Soon we crested a ridge and were happy to see we were still on track.  After dropping down we took another quick break to reapply sunscreen before starting up that last little bit to the base of The Tooth.

			The snow was melting from the rock wall, creating an interesting move for us to make to gain the rock.  We scrambled around the rocks clockwise, found some more snow to walk down, and found our way to the party.  Yes, it was like a party hanging out at the base of the route - the South Face of the Tooth.  We had about 8 people waiting to start and another 10 on the route.  We caught up with the guys we talked to at the trailhead - Zahlen, Skye, Nick, and Dan.  They were also heading to climb The Tooth, Zahlen and Skye packing in their skis to get some turns on the way down.  We found some seats among the rocks and grabbed food as we had some time to relax.  Finally the guys were starting up so we got ready ourselves.</p>
			<p>
			I climbed with Sara.  She was leading the first pitch so she racked up.  Alicia and Lina would be following us, Alicia taking the first pitch for them.  Sara found a few nice horns to sling (natural pro is my favorite) and belayed me up, with Alicia close at foot.  Once the pair in front of us headed up, I started the second pitch.  I found the rappel station but it was pretty crowded so I continued up just a little further.  The rope drag was ridiculous so I was glad to set an anchor on a tree and belay Sara up.  Having cut into the third pitch a bit, Sara went off with the understanding that if there was a good place to set up an anchor do it, or go all the way to the top.

			The third rappel station was just over the next big ledge so she continued to the top.  I could see her from a far so I shouted to her every so often, as she found lots of booty to clip on her way up.  The Tooth had claimed several pieces along the route and we clipped all that we could.  Luckily I had marked all of my gear with that in mind the night before so we didn't leave any of my pieces.  Sara found a great pocket for a #2 before the last couple moves to put her on the summit.  Lina lead the second and third pitches for her and Alicia and kept close behind me up the third and final pitch.  Our new friends were on the summit so we spent a few minutes taking in the views, getting some group pictures, and then starting down a giant group rappel.

			Nick set up some awesome rappels for the group, sending people down a single rope each with an autoblock to try and speed things up.  I waited until the end with Dan to set up the normal double rope rappel so that we could pull the ropes.  There were eight of us total with 4 ropes so they would leap frog ahead and set up the next rappel.  2 double rope rappels from the summit found us back at the base, grabbing our packs and getting ready for the final rappel down the snow gully.  We made our way down the gully with Nick and Dan, moving a little slower as for safety only one person could really rappel at a time with all of the loose rock that inevitably got kicked down.

			Zahlen and Skye scrambled back to the ski gear they had stashed and got some turns in on their way to meet us.  They skied as we started finding our way back down to our gully.  After some questions we found the one and carefully made our way down the steep snow.  Finally we reached the bottom of the gully, crossed the strip of boulders, and found ourselves back on the dirt trail.  We bid farewell to the guys and hit the trail, ready to end the long day and get some food.  It was about an 11 hour day by time we got back to the cars, thanks to our long lunch break.  It was a beautiful day and a great day of girls climbing in the mountains!</p>
