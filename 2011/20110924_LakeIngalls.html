			<h1>Lake Ingalls 9.24.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			Sara and I had been wanting to climb Ingalls most of the summer and we thought we found our opportunity.  The boys would be busy so what better way to spend the weekend than a girls climbing adventure.  Our plans involved hiking in on Saturday, camping near Lake Ingalls, climbing Sunday, and heading out.  Plenty of time to do everything and a weekend in the mountains – what more could you ask for?  Oh, that’s right – no rain, and maybe no thunderstorms if I’m making requests.  As the weekend approached the forecast got worse and worse.  Rain soon followed by a chance of thunderstorms – bad news climbing in the mountains.  We decided to change our plans to a one day assault on the mountain since the thunderstorms and rain were predicted for Sat night and Sunday.  New plan: leave Seattle at 5AM, leave the trailhead by 8AM, climb and rap down in another 4ish hours, and then the hike out landing us back at our cars about 7PM, right at sunset.  That weekend also happened to coincide with the Fremont Oktoberfest.  I had missed the previous two years due to illness and a wedding so I was excited to be partaking in the festivities again.  Friday afternoon the forecast changed again – for the worse.  Thunderstorms now predicted around 2PM – right when we were hoping to be on the summit.  Sara and I talked and we decided to plan to go still and make the call on the hike.  If the weather looked bad we’d turn around.  After a night of drinking tiny mugs of beer, we went home in preparation for our 5AM departure from Seattle.
			</p>
			<p>
			I woke up at 4:40AM, got ready and checked the weather – no thunderstorms predicted until 11PM.  Yes, an improvement from the previous night.  Sara picked me up and we headed east.  I wasn’t feeling awful but my stomach has been happier with me.  I’m guessing the mini mugs from the night before weren’t being very nice to me.  After a few pit stops along the road, we arrived at the trailhead.  I literally had nothing left in me so we debated about our plans for the day.  The weather was looking good but I was not.  We finally decided we’d at least start and turn back if I wasn’t feeling good.  It only took us an hour to get from the car to the trailhead – about 5 feet away.

			<p>
			There was a lot of laughing at the situation (well mainly me) and thoughts of naps in our way.  Sara assumed we’d hike for maybe 10 minutes and turn back so when I said we should still bring our gear (I hadn’t given up hope yet even though we were starting an hour later then our intended schedule) she played along.  I think in retrospect she knew better – I mean she was climbing with me, notorious for making less than ideal decisions of climbing when not feeling good.  I had a Gu right away to get some sort of energy source back in my body and we set off on the trail.  Sara started out in front and soon realized I was quite a bit slower and put out me out front.

			<p>
			I had my new Asolo hiking boots for the trip so about a mile into the hike, we stopped so that I could duct tape my heels to help stop the further blistering.  Like clock work about every 30 minutes my energy would be depleted and another 15 minutes after that, I’d finally stop to have another Gu.

			<p>
			It was gorgeous out and there were a lot of people at the trailhead while we sat and laughed in the car in the parking lot.  There was one group behind us that would catch up during our breaks.  Finally Sara’s boredom from moving so slowly got the better of her so she grabbed my camera and proceeded to take pictures of everything in sight, while I teetered up the path.  It almost looked like I was hiking drunk because of my wobbling (thank goodness for those trekking poles) but it was just lack of energy.

			Two years ago Sara had done the hike to the Lake and camped, and two years and a couple weeks ago I had done the hike to Ingalls Pass – rain turned me around.  We made it to Ingalls Pass and I finally got the views I had been missing – who knew Mount Stuart was right there?</p>

			<p>
			We got to the pass around 11:30, give or take 30 minutes.  We checked out the Ingalls summits and picked out what we thought the scramble route up to the base of the climb was.  The pictures we had in our beta matched up perfectly with the rock face we could see in the distance.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Our plan was to climb the south ridge of the North summit.  The start is on the ridge on the far left.</span>

			<p>
			I finally admitted defeat that we weren’t going to make the climb, so Sara suggested stashing most of our stuff at the pass while we hiked to the lake.  I had just gotten a new REI Flash 18 pack to bring up the climb, so I left my 38L Osprey pack with all of our rock gear and rope.  We continued around to the lake with many other groups of hikers, and even a few goats along the way.</p>

				<span class="caption">Nice look at the goat before he starts walking away</span>

			<p>
			Mount Stuart was awesome – always watching over us.  There were a couple of tents along the trail, right near the base of the scramble – we spotted a few cairns up the mountainside too.</p>

			<p>
			Just a few more switchbacks got us to Lake Ingalls, my first time there.  I could finally check the hike off my list after two years!  It was a gorgeous sunny day and the lake was a typical alpine lake with clear, blue-green water.  Ingalls looming directly above the lake and Mount Stuart just in the distance created a beautiful setting.</p>

				<span class="caption">Sara and I at Lake Ingalls with Mount Stuart in the background</span>

			<p>
			After a few pictures, we started venturing around the lake.  I spotted some secluded areas counter-clockwise around the lake with a small snow patch and some rock in our way.  We were up for the scramble challenge.  We crossed the small snow patch (I had to continue with my record for the year of always hiking through some snow) and after some careful consideration and moves, made it across the moat onto the rock.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara crossing the snow patch</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Next Sara and I took turns exploring various lines across the rock.  It wasn’t very easy scrambling and I was glad to have my stiff hiking boots on.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara navigating the scramble</span>

			<p>
			Finally, we decided it best not to continue and turned back to find a nice lunch spot.  We stopped on some rocks that were part in the sun (for Sara) and part in the shade (for me).  We ate, talked, and enjoyed the great day.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara trying to enjoy a nap at our lunch spot</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Finally we figured we should head back so we started the challenge of scrambling back across the rock and crossing the moat.  We made it and started the easy hike back to the car.  After another goat encounter, this one with a kid included, we reached the pass.  We grabbed our stuff, split up the water, and started down.</p>

				<span class="caption">Back at the pass where we stashed our climbing gear.  Since Sara had hauled it all this way,she  might as well place a few pieces.  Finding a crack for her #1 cam</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			My blisters were pretty wretched so I was glad to be finally heading downhill – mostly.  I started in the lead again and tried to keep up a good pace for Sara as she normally runs down mountains.  I’d slow to a snails pace at the slightest incline though.  We made good time and were back at the cars after an hour and fifteen minutes from the pass – way better than either of us expected.  I was glad to be out of my boots and Sara started the drive down the 10 mile dirt, forest service road.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">The FS road was treacherous. Ridged gravel, pot holes,  meandering cattle, and unplanned pit stops</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We stopped for some BK in Cle Elum and then headed for home.  Sara took a 5 hour energy to help her stay awake after her 4:15AM wake up for the awesome day we had (haha).  The hike wasn’t a total waste – I hope.  We got out in the mountains and we got a little more beta for the climb so hopefully it’ll be an early climb for us next year to start the season – I can’t wait!</p>
