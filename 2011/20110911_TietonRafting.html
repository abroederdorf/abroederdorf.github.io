			<h1>Tieton Rafting - 9.11.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was the beginning of September which can only mean one thing –rafting on the Tieton! It was the last BEWET trip for the season so we decided to go climbing Saturday and raft on Sunday. After a great day of climbing, we went to the Hause Creek campground to set up our tents and join in festivities with the rafting crew. They had their typical potluck Saturday night. We enjoyed some good food, chatting with friends, and sitting around the fire with a little falcon punch –in my sippy cup. I had learned from our outing to Silver Star that a low of 50 degrees meant the 10 degree sleeping bag so I slept really well that night. We woke up the next day about 8:30AM and took down camp. We finished breakfast just in time to join the caravan to the put in site. After a little detour we pulled in and finished getting ready in anticipation of the car shuttle. We slathered up in sunscreen, got our goodies for the river together like water bottles, signed in, got our life jackets and helmets, and helped Aaron N set up the boat. He was the lucky one (or unlucky one) to guide our crazy crew –we were pumped. I joined the car shuttle to the take out and parked my car in the lot –thanks to my dept of fish and wildlife pass/Discovery Pass. Once we got back to the put in we had just a little bit of time as final details were arranged so we lounged around the boat.</p>

			We had Kevin and Sara up front again, just like on the Wenatchee. The left side (strong side) was Kevin, Alyssa, and myself. Right side was Sara, Aaron P, and Lina. Sara was a champ taking front despite the death illness I unintentionally shared from our Silver Star adventure. We grabbed the raft and made our way to the water. There are some rapids as soon as you put in so we were ready.</p>

			It was a gorgeous day for rafting. I had my booties, farmer jane wetsuit, and long sleeve rash guard on. The water was cool but felt good in the hot sun. Aaron N did a great job guiding us down the river –I don't think we did anything too crazy...well maybe.</p>

			We hit the rapids well, popping almost everyone into the boat at some point –luckily everyone went in instead of out. We ran the dam left side with no issues, and got through Waffle Wall –almost losing our guide as he posed for pictures but he luckily slipped into the boat. During a calmer part he let Aaron P ride the boat.</p>

			He got on the front like a good ol' rodeo guy trying to tame the raft. After that we had some more time on the river, all being captivated by the rock we floated past (what do you expect with a boat full of climbers?). Everyone was smiles, glad to be on the river with friends.</p>

			Soon we were at the take out and paddled like pros to make it. After drying off the rafts, deflating, and rolling them for storage, we all changed into some drier clothes for the drive home and a few 'we-made-it-down-the-river' PBRs were passed out. Another great rafting trip down the Tieton, a great way to end the season.
