			<h1>Lake Stuart 10.1.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was time for the annual BOEALPS fall campout in Leavenworth.  I was excited but had a lot of work going on so my time that weekend would be limited.  I had planned to drive myself late Friday evening after a long day at work, climb Saturday, and then head back Saturday night or Sunday morning.  Somehow Sara and Kevin convinced me to ride out with them which was way more fun than driving by myself – even with the scenic driving tour through Monroe (i.e. Safeway parking lot).  They’d either head back early with me or I’d take Sara’s car back.  Aaron’s parents were also in town for the weekend festivities so it was quite the event.  The weather forecast was not looking so great so I tried to print stuff off for work.  My theory - if Saturday had bad weather, I could work a little and maybe climb Sunday morning before having to head back.  Sara and I were planning on climbing R&amp;D, a full circle sort of climbing season since that was my first multi-pitch and trad follow back at the BOEALPS spring campout.
			</p>
			<p>
			It rained Friday night so we woke up and headed to town for a proper breakfast.  On the way by the rock, everyone decided it didn’t look too bad so we headed out to Barney’s Rubble after breakfast.  The sky was threatening so I decided I’d just sit and work.  I had grabbed my tarp and trekking poles though so Sara, Alicia, and I build a fort/rain shelter.  Sara placed a few pieces of gear in the rock while Alicia and I attached the tarp to a tree and the trekking poles.  We finished just in time as it really started to come down.  After everyone was off the rock, I headed to Sara’s car, aka my weekend office, to do a little work.  The group tried their hand at a little bouldering before calling it a day.  Aaron and his family decided to go for a hike instead, since that’s not as weather dependent.  The rest of the group planned to head into town and get some mini golfing in before the group potluck that night.  I could stay and work or I could join in the hike – I decided to go for the hike, even though that meant no climbing for me that weekend.  We grabbed a quick lunch, gathered a few things like snacks and water, and piled into Snow Pea.  Luke decided he wanted to get a bit more training in so he was going to hike the 4 or so miles to the trailhead and just catch up with us along the trail – while carrying a rope and partial bottle of whiskey as training weight.  
			</p>
			<p>
			The campground we stayed at was off of the same road that lead to the trailhead, so we just continued up the rough and bumpy forest service road.  The trailhead was packed and we parked along the far side past the bathroom.  We grabbed our gear and I turned on the GPS for our adventure to Lake Stuart.  I had wanted to do the hike a couple years prior but got rained out.  I knew the trail was the same for both Colchuck Lake and Lake Stuart for about half way before splitting, but that’s about all I remembered.  I was guessing it was 4 – 5 miles one way, but wasn’t sure.  We saw Eric and Sara in the parking lot preparing for their one day hike through the Enchantments the next day.  After a quick chat we started on the trail.  Kaj jumped out front as Aaron stayed back to fill out our Alpine Lakes Wilderness permit.

			He soon caught up and we made good time up the trail, across a couple of log crossings, and finally to the main footbridge.  The water running beneath was so clear and pretty.

			Since only a few of us had the packs with water, I suggested we take a water break (go-go food and water girl), before continuing on.

			Aaron told us about the climbs that had taken him up this trail before, and where he forked off.  I was having a lot of fun taking pictures as we went, really enjoying the fall colors dotting the trail.

			Soon we reached the fork and continued to Lake Stuart.  Just a little ways up the trail we could see a bit of Aasgard Pass through the trees.  We heard foot steps coming up quickly from behind – Luke had caught us, and just in time!  We soon entered a large meadow so he told us what mountains we saw (well partially saw, it was pretty clouded in).

			<p>
			After exiting the meadow we finally spotted a little patch of blue sky above us – the first blue sky I had seen that day.  We found the no campfire sign and figured we were within about half a mile of the lake.  We planned a turn around time of 4:30 and it looked like we were right on schedule.  The trail wound its way through the trees some more and we finally reached the fork at the lake.

			Based on Luke’s recommendation we headed counterclockwise (right) around the lake.  We found a few groups there – one fishing and one setting up camp.  We made our way to the little sandy beach and enjoyed some snacks before taking a series of pictures at the lake.  It was a typical beautiful alpine lake with clear water and surrounding mountains standing guard overhead.

			Unfortunately the clouds blocked our view of the lake’s namesake – Mount Stuart, although we did catch a glimpse of the Stuart Glacier.  It was 4:30 so we started down, back to the trailhead.  The clouds lifted a little as we headed down so I got some better pictures in the meadow.

			<p>
			We chatted as we made our way back down the trail, and after 10 miles found ourselves back at the trailhead.  After knocking some mud off of our boots we piled back into Snow Pea (Aaron’s jeep), anxious for the potluck back at camp.  It was a great afternoon hike and I can finally cross Lake Stuart off of my hiking to-do list.  Now to make my way to Colchuck Lake and the Enchantments…
