			<h1>Vantage Easter Girls Weekend 4.22 - 4.24.11</h1>
			
			<p>It was Easter weekend so we had a break from the BCC class.  I was itching for some rock climbing so I thought that it was a perfect opportunity for the first girls climbing weekend of the season.  The ICC was in Leavenworth and we were heading there the following weekend for BCC, so I thought it best to try Vantage.  We put together a crew of Alicia, Alyssa, Aubrey, and Sara.  Aubrey had to head back to Seattle Saturday night so we decided to caravan out.  Alicia was landing late afternoon from a business trip to Cali so after giving her just enough time to pack for the weekend, she and Sara picked me up before heading to the east side to get Alyssa.  Luckily she packed light because the car was stuffed full of gear - tents, ropes, harnesses, quick draws - you name it, we probably had it.  And of course I had to bring some Easter goodies for the weekend.  We rendezvoused with Aubrey in North Bend at the Safeway so that we could load up on food for the weekend.  I had brought my little grill and cooler, so we grabbed some sausage for grilling Saturday night.  After Safeway we stopped at Arby's for a quick dinner and hit the road with a little over 100 miles looming ahead of us.  We pulled into the Feathers parking lot long after the sun had set, sometime around 9:30 PM.  I was the only one who had been there so we found some parking spots and started walking around looking for a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14153">camp site</a>.  We decided to fit all 5 of us in Alicia's big tent, aka the Love Shack.  There was a large group nearby that didn't seem thrilled that we parked so close, but we were heading to bed almost immediately so no harm.
			</p>
			<p>
			We woke up around 7AM the next morning.  Since Aubrey had to leave that night, I decided to do our Easter celebration that morning.  I made everyone stay in the tent while I grabbed the stuff from the car.  I had gone to Target earlier in the week and went a little overboard with the holiday spirit.  I set up a couple of Easter basket <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14144">chairs</a> - i.e. I put a bunch of candy in the camping chairs since I didn't have a big Easter basket.  I did however buy little felt <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14146">baskets</a> for the egg hunt.  I pulled 40 eggs out to hide, I figured 10 eggs per person would be a good challenge.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14145">I</a> dropped them in bushes and behind rocks in a vicinity near the tent, then told the crew to come out.  They each picked out an Easter basket and away they went, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14147">hunting</a> for the brightly colored plastic eggs. Before long all but about 5 or so of the most difficult eggs were found so it was a group effort to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14149">locate</a> the stragglers, but we did it.  Once everyone had a sufficient quantity of chocolate, we grabbed the real <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14157">breakfast</a> food and headed for the notch to eat on the southside of the Feathers.  I figured they might enjoy seeing some more of the area while we ate and let the rock warm up.  It is quite an interesting <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14143">landscape</a> - lots of windmills and brown, different from the snowy mountains we had been playing in.  After breakfast we went back and got ready for a day of climbing.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sara pulled out my guide book and found two relatively easy climbs for us to warm up on, a 5.4 and 5.5 right next to each other.  As we were discussing a few groups headed up to the rock so we took off too, before all the routes we were looking at got taken.  A group was on the 5.4 so we set up shop on the 5.5, Shake It Don't Break It.  The first bolt seemed absurdly high so I was volunteered to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14136">lead</a> it.  I flaked out my new rope, tied in, and started scaling the wall.  I put up the route and then everyone followed on top-rope for a warm up on the day.  We made a deal to switch routes with the group  next to us, they were really nice.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14118">Sara</a> jumped on the lead of the 5.4, Mandatory Suicide.  It was a fun climb in the corner with the bolts placed out <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14111">wide</a>, providing some fun sights as we had to make our way over to them.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14108">Alicia</a> decided to make it her first lead of the season as well.  After everyone had finished climbing Shake It Don't Break It, Alicia volunteered to clean the anchor. I think for everyone excluding myself, this was the first outdoor climbing trip of the year so we all had some cobwebs to dust off.  Alicia was almost done cleaning when she threw down the rope - and we saw three strands.  After some quick yelling back and forth she fixed it and rappelled down on two strands.  Alyssa also wanted to learn how to clean, so I top roped Mandatory Suicide and then belayed her from <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14104">above</a> so that we could work through the steps together.  As we were cleaning the anchor, Sara was off scouting our next possible routes.  The day was nice and the rock was starting to get a little crowded.  She made a deal with a couple on a 5.7 to switch.  Once Alyssa rappelled down with me close behind, we made our way to the west end of the northside and found another unclaimed 5.7 route.  Sara lead the first <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14101">5.7</a>, the Becky Route, and I <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14096">lead</a> the other 5.7, Ruffled Feathers.  We both had a great time so after the routes got <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14090">cleaned</a> except for the anchors, we lead the others as well.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14087">Alyssa</a> cleaned the Becky Route after me, including the anchor.  We talked through the steps before she went up and then I helped answer any questions from the ground.  She had two strands at the end of it all so she did well.  Alicia lead Ruffled Feathers as well, followed by <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14086">Aubrey</a> who then cleaned the route.  It was close to 1PM so the group finally convinced me to stop for lunch.
			</p>
			<p>
			We made the lengthy hike back to our campsite (which we almost could hit with a rock from the wall) and settled down to get some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14082">food</a> and enjoy the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14156">sun</a>.  The northside was mostly cloaked in shadows from the pillars of rock we were climbing, so <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14155">basking</a> out in the sun (with appropriate sunscreen applied) was a nice break.  It was so nice that we didn't get moving again until 3PM!  We decided the morning had gone well and that we were ready for some 5.8s.  We found two on the southside to take advantage of the sun.  The first one that is just east of the notch was open, the 5.8 Don Coyote.  I took this first <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14077">lead</a> and it was a good one.  The morning climbs hadn't posed much challenge, but Don Coyote was a bit overhung and definitely pumped my arms out.  I kept thinking about taking but would push myself to the next bolt.  Towards the top I got a bad case of the shake leg, but I finished the climb successfully.  Just as I finished, another 5.8 became available so <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14068">Sara</a> led Arterial Bypass.  She did a great job and made it to the top, also a more challenging climb then the morning ones.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14072">Aubrey</a> cleaned the route on both 5.8's since she had to get going.  Once she was done climbing Arterial Bypass, we bid her farewell.  After a break, I decided to try my luck at leading Arterial Bypass too.  I think having lead one 5.8 helped calm my nerves a little as the route seemed easier - don't get me wrong, I wouldn't call it easy but I was more at ease climbing it.  It also helped that I saw a couple people climb it before me.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14050">Alicia</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14054">Alyssa</a> were champion route cleaners, Alicia cleaning most of the anchors.  Alicia wanted one more lead so we went back to the northside so that she could lead Feather in My Cap, a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14413">5.5</a> that she would lead on sight.  I'm crazy and love climbing as much as possible so I lead belayed her up, while <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14409">Sara</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14137">Alyssa</a> enjoyed the sun and took pictures of the surroundings.  Alicia had no trouble quickly scaling the 5.5 and was lowering down to let me <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14132">clean</a> the route.  It was getting late in the day and I think everyone had gotten enough climbing in, so we headed back to our <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14109">campsite</a> for dinner.
			</p>
			<p>
			Alyssa and I <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14044">fired</a> up the grill, with Sara <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14042">tending</a> to it and helping cook the meat.  I was pretty pumped for some night climbing but I wanted it to be dark.  Another fun surprise I had with me was some hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps - which I used to help convinced everyone to wait longer for our night climbing.  As the sun went <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14041">down</a> the desert got a bit cold so everyone put on their big <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14034">puffys</a> and curled up under <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14035">blankets</a>.  Finally they convinced me to go so we grabbed our gear and headed for two of the easiest routes on the northside.  I had to take <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14032">Sprinkles</a> off to put my headlamp on - unknowingly that was the end for him but he hung out on my harness the rest of the weekend.  He was actually quite the conversation starter at the rock.  I had a couple little girls ask me what I was and talked to a few others about climbing.  People definitely remembered Sprinkles.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14027">Alyssa</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14406">I</a> took the 5.1 route, Where the Sidewalk Ends while <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14031">Sara</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14081">Alicia</a> took the 5.0, Forty Bucks in the Dark.  As they like to call it, it was a 5.0 + bats as there were several bats swooping around us as we climbed.  Sara and I both lead our respective routes.  Alyssa cleaned and rapped down while Alicia lead her route as well.  My new Spot headlamp was pretty amazing as I could light up the campground below. After our night climbing escapades we made it back to camp and promptly fell asleep.

			The forecast for Sunday initially was iffy, but we figured if we could get a full day of climbing in on Saturday we'd be happy.  Lucky for us Sunday was sunny too.  After some quick breakfast, we packed everything up in the event of nasty weather (so that we could make a hasty escape) and then grabbed our gear.  It was Easter and where else should we climb but around <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14025">Satan's Pillar</a>.  Sara started the morning off by <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14024">leading</a> the 5.6 Notch Route, the first lead I did for the season on my previous trip.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14023">5.7</a> Altar of Sacrifice opened up so I lead that one.  I had also lead the Altar of Sacrifice previously but I did a much better job on in it this time.  A little more confidence and warmer rock led to no breaks this time.  I think Alicia also lead the Notch Route, which I then decided to clean in my <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14397">Keens</a>.  I figured I was on top rope and had climbed it before, so I decided to take the challenge.  In the mean time, Sara lead Altar of Sacrifice while <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14403">Alyssa</a> spotted a really fun chimney climb, 5.5 Updrafts to Heaven.  Alyssa lead it first with each of us taking our turn to lead since it looked like so much fun.  We took lots of pictures and Alyssa got some great shots with Sara's camera and the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14013">wide</a> angle lens.  After we all lead the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14019">chimney</a> route, we turned our attention to the 5.8 on the pillar, Jesus Saves - appropriate for that Sunday.  It opened up so I jumped on the route.  It was a fun <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14010">route</a>, the most enjoyable 5.8 I climbed there.  It was right on a corner.  At one ledge I couldn't <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14408">find</a> the next move up so I spent a few minutes, but once I realized you just had to reach up high in this one area for some great handholds, I finished the climb.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14005">Alyssa</a> cleaned the route so that <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14003">Sara</a> could lead it, followed by <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13999">Alicia</a> cleaning.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sara had though about trying to lead the 5.8, Don Coyote on the southside but it was taken, so while we waited Alicia and I went to the northside so that she could get another lead in on the 5.5, Get the Pever Fever.  She did a great job, climbing on sight once again.  When we got over to the southside Alyssa was just coming down off of the 5.9, Me Too.  I had climbed it on top rope during my previous trip but wasn't feeling the need to lead it.  Unfortunately we had tried talking Alyssa out of leading it so when she got up to the third bolt, all that talk got to her and she decided to down climb it all.  Sara wanted to try it so she had a lot of fun <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13995">leading</a> the 5.9 crack.  During their climbing Alyssa had managed to put a rock on a little snake, effectively trapping it in place.  When I bent down to look at it, the tail seemed to be rattling - I was pretty sure she trapped a baby <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13998">rattlesnake</a>.  After the rope was picked up Alyssa felt bad and decided to free the snake who in turn showed it's gratitude by trying to strike her twice - good thing the little guy missed.  We had our fill of climbing for the weekend so we threw our gear in the car and headed back to Seattle, with a pit stop in Ellensburg for some food.  The four dirty climbers fit in great with all of the families out for Easter dinner.  Overall it was a great weekend, definitely a good contribution to climbing season!  I really enjoyed leading and can't wait to get more practice while learning more about rock climbing.</p>
