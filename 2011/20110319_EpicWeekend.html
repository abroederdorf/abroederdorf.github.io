			<h1>Epic Weekend 3.19 - 3.20.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			I’ve really wanted to get out rock climbing and was disappointed the weather wasn’t better the weekend before.  Aaron had mentioned going to Vantage and I’ve been itching to climb some rock ever since.  The forecast didn’t look great again for the weekend, although Sunday had a low chance for rain.  I had wanted to go skiing again – inbounds though to try and redeem my confidence from the Yodelin backcountry trip the prior weekend.  I heard it was suppose to snow 11 inches at Stevens Friday night so the plan fell into place – ski at Steven’s Saturday, then continue on to Vantage that night to camp and climb the next day.  When I checked the forecast again Friday, the predicted snow was reduced to only a couple inches but we were still heading skiing.  The Snow Pea crew for the weekend would include <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13714">Aaron, Matt</a>, and myself – we filled up the trunk pretty well with our gear.  I loved the concept of going from skiing in snow to camping and climbing in the desert.</p>
			<p>
			Matt made some breakfast Saturday morning so we hit the road about 8AM, a leisurely start.  It had actually snowed 7 inches but the snow was a bit on the heavy side and a little chunky.  After a warm up run on <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13712">Skyline</a>, we headed up <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13702">Hogsback</a> to take <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13711">Tye Mill</a> to the backside.  I decided to bring my camera and GPS for once and I’m glad I did.  It was one of the best days I’ve been skiing all season in terms of weather – sunshine and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13708">blue</a> skies mixed with clouds.  I thought it’d be fun to have the GPS along so my goal was to hit all of my normal runs and I almost accomplished that, minus a couple off of Hogsback.  After a few runs on the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13709">backside</a> we headed down to the lodge for a quick snack and drinks.  Considering the good weather, the resort was relatively quiet which was nice.  We did a couple more runs on Hogsback and Big Chief before heading up <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13767">Skyline</a> for a final run to the cars.  Overall a nice, easy day of skiing.</p>
			<p>
			We packed up and headed to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13696">Leavenworth</a> for some dinner.  We decided to take a quick detour down <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13700">icicle creek</a> to check out the rock.  There was still quite a bit of snow but the rock was fairly decent, some of it pretty wet though.  We got out to inspect <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13699">Barney’s Rubble</a>.  It was interesting to see nearby Bruce’s Boulder covered in snow too – that was my first real day of rock climbing at last year’s spring campout.  We headed back to town and grabbed some sausage and beer while eating in the sun.  After a quick stop at the Safeway to pick up food and drinks for camping, we were back on the road, heading to Vantage.</p>
			<p>
			We pulled into the first lot by Feathers and found a few groups climbing and a few campsites set up.  We got our tents up, sleeping bags rolled out, and put the puffy’s on, then headed to the walkthrough in Feathers to check out the other side.  Aaron was the only one who had climbed at Vantage before out of the crew.  Saturday night just happened to be the perigee of the moon’s orbit so it was suppose to appear the biggest it has since 1993.  Luckily there were only a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13756">clouds</a> in the sky so we waited for the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13755">rising</a> moon.  I grabbed my camera and started playing with long exposure, getting pictures of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13766">campfires</a> below and the blinking <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13759">lights</a> of the windmills in the distance.  The sky was starting to light up but the rocks were in our way, so we decided to do a little exploring.  Aaron found a good area to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13761">scramble</a> up so we went up and were met with a view of the moon.  It was unbelievably <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13760">bright</a> and looked like a sun in my long exposure pictures.  The moonshine even cast <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13758">shadows</a> from us on the rocks nearby.  We scrambled back down and I continued taking pictures, capturing the rock columns of Feathers, the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13754">valley</a> nearby lit up like the sun was shining across it, the moon rising above the rocks, and even Aaron <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13753">glowing</a>.  A few more cars arrived and soon there were a couple groups night climbing.  After finishing our drinks and almost getting some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13750">hot tamales</a> to eat, we headed to bed in anticipation of climbing the next morning.</p>
			<p>
			The forecast called for 30% chance of rain and temperatures in the mid 50’s, so we planned to sleep in and hope that the rock would warm up a bit.  The game plan was to climb at the Feathers in the morning so I could do some sport leading, then head over to Sunshine Wall in the afternoon so the guys could do some trad leading and let me clean.  When we finally emerged from the tents, the sky was overcast and it was cold – Snow Pea showed temperatures right around 40 degrees.  After a quick run into Vantage, we found Monica, Mark, and Glen who were meeting us for some climbing.  We headed up near Satan’s Pillar and set up a few ropes there.  Matt led the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13738">5.9</a> roof route, <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/vantage_frenchman_coulee/the_feathers/106515723">Shin Smasher</a>, while I lead the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13741">5.6</a> <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/vantage_frenchman_coulee/the_feathers/106279516">Notch Route</a>.  The route was pretty easy but after the third bolt my hands were really cold and made me a little nervous.  I was able to put up the route cleanly and learned that I need to focus on keeping myself warm.  Next I led a nearby <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13735">5.7</a> up <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/vantage_frenchman_coulee/the_feathers/106582612">Altar of Sacrifice</a>.  I had to take on that as my hands again were really cold and I was hesitant, trying to find a good solid route up from the fourth bolt to the anchor.  I finally made it up.  I also tried climbing with my hiking socks on and it seemed to work – although my hands were the biggest concern still.  It started drizzling so we went to the south side of the Feathers, where it was slightly warmer since Satan’s Pillar seemed to put us right in the middle of a steady wind.  Aaron led the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13727">5.9</a> <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington/vantage_frenchman_coulee/the_feathers/106597507">Me Too</a>, which all of us then climbed as well.  It was a bit overhung and I was glad that I didn’t lead it, it was enough effort just to climb.  After playing with some of Aaron’s trad gear, we packed up and headed to Ellensburg.  It was cold and rainy but we at least got a few climbs in.  Overall it was a fun weekend, and I can’t wait to get out on more rock – hopefully when it’s a little warmer.</p>
