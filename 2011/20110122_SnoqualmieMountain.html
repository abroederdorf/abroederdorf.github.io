			<h1>Snoqualmie Mountain 1.22.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			My first true climbing adventure for the year was to Snoqualmie Mountain, the highest in the Commonwealth Basin.  There was no backcountry ski gear along, only <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13314">snowshoes</a>, trekking poles, and ice axes.  The crew for this adventure included Luke, Aubrey, Niki, Aaron P, and myself.  We drove all the little cars out to Snoqaulmie Pass and met at the Summit West parking lot at 7 AM.  After gearing up, we started for the trail about 7:25 AM.  The beginning of the climb was very familiar as it is the same approach for Guye Peak which I did last spring with the BCC.  Our first obstacle was crossing the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13315">creek</a>.  In class we also had some difficulty finding a good way across.  The bridge was stacked high with snow so we opted to continue on.  Aaron crossed in one section but the rest of us felt the water level was too high for our preference - we didn't want wet feet for the rest of the trip.  Finally, the three girls found a suitable spot and we crossed without any issues.  Once on the other side, we donned our snowshoes and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13310">continued</a> on our way up to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13308">saddle</a> between Guye Peak and Snoqualmie Mountain.  I had just gotten a new pair of snowshoes from Steep and Cheap, the Louis Garneau Freeshape FX Apex - Women's edition.  I was excited for the weekend adventure to try them out.  Overall I liked the snowshoes.  The straps are attached and create a nice handle for cinching them down.  My only issue was with the ascender bar, my one foot was too far forward and I kept missing the bar.  I tried readjusting but it was still hit or miss whether my foot landed on the bar or not.  Also, after using Niki's MSR Lightning Ascents on the last snowshoeing adventure, I noticed the ascendar bar is not nearly as high.  I'm not sure if I actually noticed a difference or not while climbing though.</p>
			<p>
			We were soon heading up towards the saddle and I tried my best to keep a steady pace and not slow the crew down too much.  I kicked steps for a while, not sure I chose the best way up - we found ourselves on some steep snow.  Just as we started getting close to the saddle, we could see some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13306">blue</a> trying to peek through the clouds.  We started the morning with clouds overhead and some very light snow flurries.  After a quick snack break we headed down just a little from the saddle to get to the ridge leading up Snoqualmie Mountain.  We passed a large rock face covered in ice.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13297">Niki, Aubrey, and Luke</a> kicked all of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13300">steps</a> up the ridge - and for most of the climb.  I'm unfortunately a lot slower than the rest of the crew so I was usually about 5 minutes behind.  As we got higher, the clouds started disappearing.  Our first views were of some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13298">peaks</a> just poking through the cloud layer.  We could finally see a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13302">hazy</a> summit as well with a brilliant <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13295">blue</a> sky behind.</p>
			<p>
			The last part of the ridge was beautiful.  Snow covered <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13290">mountains</a> all around, and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13289">Mt Rainier</a> was out to the south.  We made our way up the ridge, weaving in and out of the trees, trying to avoid the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13294">icy</a> patches.  Up ahead Aaron and I saw the crew stop and take off their snowshoes.  When we caught up, we understood why - it was pretty icy with some nice rocks around.  We took off our snowhoes, grabbed our ice axes, and followed their steps up to the top.  Cresting the mountain provided even better <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13283">views</a> (as to be expected).  There was a short traverse over to the actual summit so as <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13291">Aaron</a> left to rejoin the group, I caught my breath and snapped several <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13292">photos</a>.  I made my way over to the true <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13288">summit</a> just in time to head <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13282">back</a> to find a less windy place for some lunch.  A much needed break along with some food did me good.  After a quick <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/13281">group</a> shot, we put on rain pants in anticipation of some glissading, packed up, and headed back down the mountain.</p>
			<p>
			I was again the last one down and Luke guided me down the best steps to navigate through the icy patches.  There was the usual plunge stepping with some down climbing and high dagger thrown in the mix.  The high dagger was interesting as we used the pick of our ax to add stability as we kicked our toes into the ice to cross the slope to some nicer snow.  This was definitely the most challenging part of the climb because of both nerves and the work it required.  Finally we were down past most of the ice and on our way.  After all that work of down climbing, I had to shed a bunch of layers as I had warmed up quite a bit and was not feeling the best.  We did get one good glissade in down the rest of the ridge, before we crossed the little creek and ascended to the saddle.  Most of the way down from the saddle we followed our tracks up, and right at the end we got another mini glissade in.  By time we reached the creeks again, the bridge had been cleared so we happily took that across.  My legs were dead and I wasn't really sure how I kept moving.  Once across the final creek, we encountered several snowshoers.  The path was well compacted and after a relatively nice day, the snow was wet and slick, making some of the slight inclines interesting in our boots.  I decided to glissade down part of the path even, it was fun.  We made it back to the cars about 3:30 PM and headed to the brew pub in Issaquah for some celebratory food and drinks.  Overall it was a great day.  A good climb that kicked my butt but provided some amazing views of the beautiful mountains in Washington.</p>
