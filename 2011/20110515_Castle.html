			<h1>Castle 5.15.11</h1>
			
			<p>A repeat of last weekend basically - heading down to the Tatoosh range just south of Mt Rainier with an equally dismal weather forecast.  Rain both days and a bad avalanche forecast.  Even though the Northwest Avalanche Center (NWAC) had stopped issuing regular reports for the regions, it still issued special statements including the following exerpt:
			</p>
			<p class="tab2">
			This is NOT the weekend you had hoped for, but is one in which your safest options should NOT include back country travel. Whether skier, boarder, rider, snowshoer, hiker or climber, we strongly recommend avoiding steeper avalanche terrain and remaining well away from avalanche path run-out zones. Remember that wet slides can and do travel relatively long distances over lower angle terrain...and even small wet slides may be dangerous if terrain traps are part of the mix.
			</p>
			<p>
			We'd be the only crazy ones in the backcountry for the weekend.  Due to the dismal forecast and not wanting to climb in wet gear on Sunday, we decided to stay in Seattle and leave in the afternoon on Saturday again.  I carpooled with the Aarons and having learned from the previous weekend, we arrived to already cooking lasagna brought by Sunday outing people - no waiting on the Saturday folks to start dinner this weekend.  We laid out our sleeping bags in the same room and joined in the feasting downstairs while listening to the stories of the day from the Saturday people.  The weather had actually turned out a lot better than I expected, not starting to rain until close to 5.  Of course we didn't arrive until after 6 so it was all rain to us and we were not looking forward to climbing it in the next day.  The teams on Pinnacle and Castle had both summited successfully, unfortunately we weren't expecting the same happy ending.  Team Fuster Cluck was to tag Pinnacle first, setting up the ropes and Team Black was going to set ropes on Castle.  We'd switch peaks and carrying down the other team's ropes.  The Saturday teams said they walked all the way up to the summit of Pinnacle, there was so much snow.  With the bad avalanche forecast and the rain overnight, we weren't sure how far we'd get to the peaks.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sunday morning I woke up and felt fine - yes!  I had been careful to avoid Gatorade the night before as that was a common element in the prior two weeks.  I'm not sure if the Gatorade was the cause but avoiding it may have helped me feel better - whatever it takes to wake up feeling good.  Despite the crummy weather, I was pumped for the climb since I actually felt good.  We met in the warming <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14444">hut</a> at Narada Falls to talk about the options for the day.  Pinnacle has a lot more exposure to avalanche dangers so we would approach from the Castle side.  Our morning options were to go as far as we could or to stop in the trees and build a snow pit.  No one wanted to climb in the conditions but we had to do something for the BCC outing.  We started out, not knowing what would come of the day.  We climbed the slope from the end of the road at  Narada Falls to intersect the Stevens Canyon <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14442">road</a> which was closed to cars still.  It was quite the sight - <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14432">24</a> people climbing together.  Shella's team kicked steps the entire way with our team in tow.
			</p>
			<p>
			We <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14438">found</a> the spot to turn off from the road and were pleasantly surprised to find we had been climbing/walking in snow and not rain.  We decided to continue on toward Castle.  Our objective had shifted to tagging Castle with Team Black.  The snow was steady as we soon gained elevation over the various <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14436">ridges</a> - all in line like a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14435">colorful</a> train.  We passed the other teams <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14431">steps</a> from the day before, heading up a route that we deemed to exposed for the conditions on Sunday.  Finally we saw a bit of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14433">peak</a> in sight, and after finding our way up another ridge, we saw the peaks - <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14424">Pinnacle</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14426">Castle</a> in a sea of white just south of us.  Again we made a decision to keep following Team Black to Castle instead of trying to find out way up Pinnacle.  We kept to the outside of a bowl, near the trees, as we made our way around to Castle.  As we were <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14421">ascending</a> the last little bit to the peak, Aaron P and Sergey headed off to Pinnacle to see if conditions were ok for us to try a summit.  The rest of us continued up to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14422">Castle</a> and started putting our harnesses on as well as some more clothes.  Shella and Bernie were going to put up a couple ropes to the summit, and after their team had all summited, Samra and I were to take over the belay roles to get our team to the top as well.  As the two started out to lead the final pitch, they were met with ice.  We were about 20 feet from the top, only a few rocks separating us from claiming the peak but the ice was too much.  It was decided that the teams couldn't all safely climb the last bit.  After some communication with Aaron via radio, they too had decided Pinnacle was not a good idea for the group.  4 hours into our climb, just about 11AM, we decided to turn around.  We gathered up the gear and glissaded down the first slope.
			</p>
			<p>
			The climb back down to the cars was actually quite fun.  We had several opportunities for glissading, the best ones of the class so far.  There was a steep chute and another one that wound through the trees.  Aaron and I did a glissade train down one of the first chutes that wasn't too steep.  After glissading through the trees, Team Black bombed us with a snowball fight, which then turned into a competition of how many Samra-saults you could do.  Samra obviously won with 9 for the day.  We were soon back on the road which seemed to take forever, as any road hike at the end of a climb does.  We finally reached the last slope separating us from our cars and warm, dry clothing.  Shella thought it'd be fun to have team glissading. Four groups going down, the students and instructors from each team.  It was a bit terrifying and fun all at the same time.  The Fuster Cluck instructors made it down ok, but unfortunately the students did not when Kevin's leg got stuck in a hole and he was then bowled over by a few more teammates (he was leading the glissade train out front).  Not counting the injury, I actually had a great time on the climb.  From a miserable day of rain and terrible conditions to almost summitting and getting lots of good glissades in, I had fun.  Not an ideal day for climbing but the team made the best of it.  After debriefing and drinking some beer in the warming hut, we stopped at our favorite Eatonville restaurant - Bruno's - for some tasty food on the way home.  We got back so early that I even got a couple loads of laundry done - now that's what I call a productive day!
