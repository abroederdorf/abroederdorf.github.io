			<h1>Silver Star Attempt 9.3 - 9.5.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			It was Labor day which meant we had three full days for some crazy mountain adventure. Aaron N had picked the weekend for his ICC grad climb and was planning to climb Paisano with Brandon. Aaron P and Matt would go as a second team, since some bad thai food the previous year had foiled their plans. Sara and I decided to head out that same direction to hang out with the boys for the weekend as well. We decided to climb Silver Star so that we could still camp with them. Silver Star and Paisano are not three day climbs but we figured we had the time so we'd make it a relaxing weekend. Unfortunately the Tuesday preceding the weekend I started to get sick. I let Sara know but didn't know myself if I'd go on the trip until the morning of. A sore throat persisted for a few days which wasn't too bad, but then the congestion and runny nose started –great. I hit the drug store prior to the trip and picked up cough drops and small packages of kleenex. I put a little Vick's in a ziploc baggie and grabbed the dayquil and nightquil. I packed up Friday night, still allowing myself the opportunity to back out the next morning if I woke up feeling absolutely horrible. Our plan was to leave Seattle about 7AM and hike to the bench to make camp that night. Both teams would climb Sunday, then we'd hike back out Monday morning. </p>
			<p>
			I woke up Saturday morning and contemplated if I should go. Everyone showed up and I double checked with Sara that she wouldn't be too disappointed if we didn't make the summit of Silver Star. She seemed ok with it, so I hit the road with the crew. We stopped for breakfast just outside of Marblemount at Tootsie's restaurant –unfortunately they were already out of cinnamon rolls. Apparently you have to reserve them ahead of time. We made a quick pit stop at the Blue Lake Trailhead and parked along highway 20 a few miles beyond that. We got our gear together and hit the trail about 12:30PM. You can see the approach clearly up to the Burgundy Col, as well as the summit of Silver Star, from the road.</p>

				<span class="caption">Our objectives for the weekend</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			The boys pointed out the bench area which was our objective for the day to set up camp. The hike starts with a descent of a couple hundred feet down a rocky/bouldery slope from the road. It's a good sign of what's to come -little did I know at the time. I brought up the rear, moving slow. I had my camping gear for a couple days and gear for glacier travel –ice axe, crampons, pickets, and a couple pieces of pro just in case we wanted them while on the rock. I brought a #.5 cam and odd nuts #5-11 along with a couple of double slings. The beta said it should be a scramble up the summit if you could stay on route. Some of the trip reports we had found said people placed a few pieces so we wanted to be prepared just in case. Sara was carrying Aaron N's glacier rope which he graciously let us borrow (go 3lb rope!) as well as a couple of double slings and cams #.75 and her favorite #2. </p>
			<p>
			Once down the initial bouldery slope there is a short hike over flat terrain through the trees that brings you to the creek crossing. Aaron P and Matt had hiked in the year before and made it to the bench before having to turn around, so they knew where the trail and water source was which was a big help. We found a nice log and took turns crossing one at a time. After that the trail winds its way through the flat trees a little longer before starting steeply up. I was trying to go slow but I still wasn't feel great. I took one quick rest break and then another, my stomach just not quite right. On my second break Sara gave me a choice –turn back or hand off some of my gear to her, Matt, and Aaron P to help carry.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara's pack loaded up with my gear –2 helmets, 2 ice axes, picket, extra water</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			I begrudgingly handed off my gear as I didn't want to turn around but also felt bad loading them down even more. We weren't 100% certain that I'd make it up to the bench so we made a quick plan with the guys since the two of us had come in different cars. If we weren't up to the bench by about 6PM, they'd come down the trail for us to help carry our stuff the rest of the way. If we decided it best to turn around, I'd leave Sprinkles and a note by the side of the trail where we turned around so that they didn't continue all the way down. We'd come back Monday to pick them up. With that the guys took off as they wanted to set up camp and do some recon hiking for their climb the next day. Sara kept a nice slow pace for me, checking to make sure I was still with her. We moved slow but I started feeling better. We started moving better, gaining another 500' before we knew it. We had about 2400' total that day –usually not a problem but very challenging for me that day to say the least. We took a few longer breaks to let me settle a little and get some Gu for energy. We were crossing over some fallen trees at one point and with one leg over, I decided it made a great seat so we took a little break right there. Unfortunately our leisurely start meant that we were hiking in the heat of the afternoon. It was sunny with a deep blue sky which looked beautiful in contrast to the dry, dead, white trees we passed on the trail.</p>

				<span class="caption">The trail up to the bench</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We'd get breaks in the trees every so often and glimpse the mountains surrounding us, like the Liberty Bell group. Sara was always on the lookout for a good rest stop for me so she found a nice shady one with some rocks. We decided to stop, unbeknownst to me that we were about 5 minutes from camp. I grabbed some Gu while Sara honed her Ptarmigan calling skills and soon made friends with 3 Ptarmigans. She finally got me up and going and before we knew it, we were standing in camp.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara taking a break with me, calling to the Ptarmigans that were walking around us</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			It had taken us about 3 hours to do the hike –a lot better than I think either of us expected after my very slow start. The guys were no where in sight so we figured they had gone off on their scouting hike already. We got our sleeping bags out, Sara got her tent put up, and we lounged around. There were some great rocks for lounging in the sun. Soon the guys appeared as they had just gone to get water from the little trickle nearby. They got their gear together and took off for the start of Paisano.</p>

			<p>
			They planned to stash their gear so they could move quicker in the morning. Sara and I had a couple of hours to hang out while they were gone so we both pulled out some reading material. I brought my Nook and Sara brought a smaller book –she had two depending on if we thought we'd do any climbing or not. We figured we'd try something so she brought the smaller book. Sara was in search of the quickly diminishing sunlight so she grabbed the footprint for her tent and laid it out like a beach towel –we were in a lot of dust, kind of sand like.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara lounging in the sun at camp on her footprint</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We discovered that each of us had brought a small deck of cards –again anticipating the worst with me not being able to climb –so after some reading we played a few different card games until the guys came bounding back down the path. Finally, it was dinner time! I had my favorite Mountain House meal, chicken and rice. It worked well because it's almost like a chicken and rice soup, perfect for someone who is sick. The guys were starting at 5:30AM the next morning so that they could be climbing at sun-up, so we retired fairly early. It was dark, getting cool, and we didn't have a fire either so perfect reasons to hit the hay. Sara and I came up with our plan –our objective was to get to the Burgundy Col and from there decide if we'd try for Silver Star or do the scramble up Vasiliki Tower. Our start time was whenever I woke up and felt well 
			enough to get going. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In trying to pack light I had brought my 35 degree sleeping bag as the lows were suppose to be 45 –50 degrees those nights. Unfortunately my 35 degree bag meant I was a little cold while sleeping. Not cold enough to keep me from sleeping, but enough to keep me from sleeping well. When Aaron got up at 5AM and left the tent he covered me with his sleeping bag –that sweet guy. It was so nice and warm that I got a few good hours of sleep. I woke up about 8AM and woke Sara up. She had a similar night and crawled into Matt's sleeping bag when he left to get a few good hours of sleep as well –so I think we both needed the extra sleep. We looked up at the rock, trying to find the guys while we ate a little breakfast. I wasn't feeling too bad so we got our packs ready and started up. I felt well enough that Silver Star wasn't entirely out of the question so we lugged up our glacier gear. Learning from yesterday, Sara demanded my gear right away. I mean everyone should carry two of everything –two ice axes, two pairs of crampons, two pickets, that makes sense. Oh, and don't forget my extra liter of water too.</p>

				<span class="caption">The base of the gully up –the start of a fun day on loose rock and dirt</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We followed the trail through the bench and soon found ourselves at the bottom of the gully. We were heading up the gully climbers left of the main gully that lead to the col. We'd be hiking up beneath Vasiliki Tower. The gully was interesting –loose rock and dirt. Sara basically kicked steps in the dirt for me as we went up. We spotted some cairns and started winding our way up and right across the gully. I was constantly popping cough drops as my throat was really dry and that was all I could do to keep from drinking my two liters of water in the first 15 minutes.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara waiting for me before heading up towards the next cairn as we make our way up the gullies to Burgundy Col</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			It was like a scavenger hunt on the way up. We were searching for the cairns and looking for the guys on Paisano. We finally spotted them about an hour into our hike and saw them throughout the morning, making their way up. It was sunny out but we were hiking up in the shadows cast by the rocky peaks above us. We always seemed to be about 10 –15 minutes in front of the sun. We finally made our way into the final gully and reached Burgundy Col. I was pretty excited since that was my goal for the day. There were some great views of the North Cascades from there and I snapped a few pictures.</p>

			<p>
			We also got our first views of the backside of the col and what we'd have to cross on our way to the summit of Silver Star. There was a steep snow section down. We got on it at the top of the col to check it out, and much to Sara's expectations, it was pretty solid ice. We talked over times for the rest of the day in order to make our next plan. We wanted to be heading back down the gully to camp by 5PM to make sure we'd allow ourselves enough time to descend in the sunlight. That left us about 5.5 hours to make the summit and get back to the col. We decided to go for the summit.

				<br>
				<span class="caption">The snow pack down from the Burgundy Col</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We knew we'd need crampons on the snow pack and that we'd want to head down, kicking toes in and using the picks of our ice axes in a high dagger of sorts. I thought it might be easier to downclimb the rock as far as we could instead of going down the snowpack the full couple hundred feet. Boy was I wrong. Sara went first and the rock was worse than ever. Dirt piles everywhere that would send you sliding, and the rock gave way. Half the holds we tried using easily pulled away from the rock. Sara went first as I stayed high. The rocks that we unavoidably kicked down landed and slid down the snowpack right where we needed to downclimb. I stayed high until Sara had made it down the snowpack and was clear off to the side. Unfortunately this added quite a bit of time to our descent but was by far the only real, safe option. We had our ice axes out from checking the snow pack and downclimbed with them –talk about crazy, haha. Since I didn't have my trekking poles (we stashed them at the col) I thought it might help me. It was just a nuisance that I let hang down until I finally stashed it between my back and pack. That was the most treacherous downclimbing I've ever done. With half of the holds pulling out it took me quite a while to make it. I was glad to reach the snow pack and tried as quickly as possible to put my crampons on. I slowly downclimbed the rest of the snow pack until I was on the traversing boot pack and met back up with Sara who was waiting, watching my progress.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Looking across the traverse after reaching the bottom of the col. Vasiliki Ridge in the background.</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			We had decided against roping up already as the traverse across the snow pack seemed pretty good and there was a large runout below us. We also had a ways to go before we reached the glacier. We slowly made our way across to the break in the next ridge. For the first time that day, we were standing in sunlight. It was about 1PM. We had about 1100' left and about 1.5 hours to do it in. Normally that'd be no problem but I didn't feel like I had the energy to go up, come down, go up the col, and down to camp. I finally said no, I couldn't go any further.</p>

				<span class="caption">Sara and I on the ridge, the end of our climb for the day</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Luckily Sara is an awesome climbing partner and was OK with that decision –in addition to carrying all of my gear and climbing at a snails pace throughout the weekend. We didn't actually get to see our target as we needed to traverse around a shoulder still but were kind of happy with the progress we had been able to make (or at least I was).</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">We had to traverse to the shoulder before getting to the glacier and heading up to the saddle before scrambling up the summit</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			I took a few pictures and about a ten minute break to recoup some energy as well as eat another Gu. We were off back across the snow pack, digging those crampons in. We made it back to the col and had a couple hundred feet to climb up. The climb up was much easier and we stayed on the snowpack all the way to the top of the col.</p>

			<p>
			I had basically lost my voice on our way down the col so I was popping cough drops like there was no tomorrow, my throat burning. I took my time at the col, repacking my gear. Sara again insisted on carrying most of it so I finally handed it over. Sara had spotted the guys starting to rappel down from Paisano so she chatted with them a bit. We considered waiting for the guys but since I was moving slow we decided to start, figuring they'd catch up soon. We grabbed our trekking poles and started down.</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Sara waiting behind a wind wall at the col for me to get my gear together, the area generally used as a bivy site</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			Heading down was a bit of another route finding adventure. We knew we had to traverse over to our ascent gully. We followed the cairns although there are several sets across the area. We started finding some landmarks from the way up and knew we were on the right path. We had a slightly different descent then ascent path, but never got lost and found our way down to the initial gully. Heading down the gully was just as interesting as the ascent. We were basically plunge stepping down in the dirt and rocks, as well as boot glissading (chossading as one of the guys said).</p>

				<br>
				<span class="caption">Heading back down the gully full of loose dirt and rocks</span>
			</center>
			<p>
			I tried hard not to dislodge any rocks down on Sara –I think we both did a pretty good job. There were a few rocks that started to slide that I picked up and repositioned. I was happy to get back on the normal dirt trail on the bench. Not only was I off the sliding dirt piles of death, I was almost back to camp. </p>
			<p>
			Once back at camp Sara and I grabbed the water bottles we could find and went to the water trickle to filter some water for the guys when they got back. As we walked back up the trail the guys were waiting in camp for us. They had climbed Paisano and accomplished their goal –overall I think it was a fairly good day for both groups. We started dinner and the crew passed around some celebratory drinks.</p>

			I had my chicken and rice again and for the second time finished the entire meal. After dinner the guys decided they hadn't done enough climbing and went whiskey bouldering. There were some rather large boulders near camp so they had fun wrestling them.</p>

			<p>
			Sara and I had our flip flops on already so we found some more sandal friendly rocks to ascend. We watched the sunset as it cast a beautiful orange glow on the rock faces –followed by some pink. After a bit more hanging out we retired for the night. Aaron gave me his puffy (read: his pillow) to wear so I was much warmer and slept pretty well. </p>
			<p>
			We woke up about 7AM and were packed up and heading down about 7:30AM. Sara and I started off a little ahead since we figured it'd take me a while to get down. Again I wasn't allowed to descend with most of my gear as Sara and Aaron split it up. We made fairly good progress. The path was steep and rocky, but at least not as bad as the gully. We followed the trail down and soon found ourselves at the log crossing again.</p>

			The last challenge of the weekend was just ahead –the last hundred feet or so up to the road. I popped a cough drop and started out at my slow pace. I was the last one up and we were back at the cars about 9:30AM, not too bad.</p>

			A successful (well mostly) weekend! I unfortunately kept us from summiting Silver Star but we still got some climbing adventure in and the guys checked Paisano off their list. I wouldn't mind trying Silver Star again but I think both Sara and I will wait for the snow so that we don't have to deal with the chossy gullies again. I survived them once –I don't want to push my luck. A big thanks to Sara for being such a great sport and hanging in there with me throughout the weekend! She humored me so that I could still have some adventure for the weekend instead of just sitting at home.</p>
