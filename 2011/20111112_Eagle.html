			<h1>Eagle 11.12.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			Aaron wanted to go on a steep snow/ice climbing adventure so he found something more entry level for me and talked Aaron N and Luke into joining him as well.  Our sights were on Lane Peak in the Tatoosh, just south of Mount Rainier in the national park.  There was snow expected Friday night through the rest of the weekend, the brunt of it expected to fall on Saturday.  We picked Saturday and decided to leave Seattle about 5AM to get to the Narada Falls parking lot (Stevens Canyon road to Reflection Lakes closed Nov 1 for the season) and be moving by 8AM.  Luke picked us up and we arrived at the park no problem.  As we passed Longmire we saw the gate across the road to Paradise.  The road was closed until 11AM for snow removal - 11AM!!!!  It was only 7AM so that completely changed our plans.  We headed into the lodge at Longmire and the nice lady at the desk called the park to ask about the road closure.  They estimated it should be between 8:30 and 9AM when the road would  open.  Still a little late, especially considering the weather we expected to be blowing in.  Begrudgingly, we changed our plans to hike back up to Eagle.</p>

			I had hiked up that way once for BCC and another time last January with the crew as they were skiing and I went snowshoeing.  Our BCC trip had us completely off course and heading up Chutla.  Our January trip was beautiful with blue skies and mountains as far as the eye could see, but we weren't planning on summiting any mountains.  This would be my third attempt at an Eagle Summit.  I had at least summited one Tatoosh peak (finally) this year when I lead a climb up Unicorn.  Could it be the day I'd get my second Tatoosh summit?
			</p>
			<p>
			We re-evaluated the gear we intended to lug with us.  We all had crampons, ice tools, and some rock pro for the climb up Lane.  The boys still all took their ice tools and crampons while I elected to leave my stuff behind, so I brought the rock pro up.  There was one other group in the lodge with us that had intended on climbing Castle/Pinnacle, so they too changed their plans to include Eagle instead.  We started out on the trail as they were getting ready, but my slow, plodding pace soon let them pass us.  The trail had only a few inches of snow on it for half way up through the trees.  This trip would definitely have the least amount of snow I had ever hiked through up to Eagle.  Half way up there was about 6 inches of snow, with some good footprints from the group in front of us.  We finally reached the hillside meadow and joked about how different it looked from January when the guys were all skiing down it and I was glissading - unfortunately there wasn't enough snow for any glissading that day.</p>

			I dropped to the back of the group finally - they had put me out front so that I could go at a more reasonable pace for myself.  We started up the hillside and were surprised the trail went pretty much where they had skinned up last year - even though there was no evidence of the trail at that time of year.  The trail had a high bank on the uphill side which made it like a little chute.  We found our way meandering through the trees in the flat area right before we reached the base of the climb up to the saddle.  The weather was definitely socked in and the wind was picking up - it was pretty chilly.  We met the other group on the last bit of the trail to the saddle.  We wound our way up the little switchbacks to the saddle, threw another layer on, and headed up to the summit block of Eagle.</p>

			There was plenty of bushwacking on the way up.  I reached the rock face separating us from the summit.  Aaron P was gearing up to lead the pitch up.  He had pitons he had gotten from Robert and I gave him the rock pro I had brought.  After he got his crampons on, harness on, and racked the gear, he started up.  Never having lead a dry tooling pitch, he got up a few moves and didn't find anywhere good to put pro so he headed down to check out the route again.  After deciding it was better to stay on the ground than lead with lots of sharp objects around, Aaron N decided to give the lead a go.  He started up and pounded in a piton where Aaron P had gotten to.</p>

			However, he didn't like the placement and pulled the piton out.  Then he downclimbed as his hands were really cold and hurting from pounding the piton in.  After examining the route again and talking things over, Aaron N gave it one more shot.</p>

			We decided it wasn't worth the risk as the guys wanted a little more dry tooling experience before leading the 50ish foot pitch of fairly unprotectable rock.  Luke wanted to try a few moves of dry tooling before we packed up to head down.  I wish I would have brought my big puffy as it was really cold.</p>

			Aaron P and I started down as I needed to warm up to get feeling back in my hands.  We made it back through all the trees and bushes, using a few green belays along the way, and were back at the saddle with the trail home.  The wind was blowing pretty good and it had started snowing while the guys were climbing.  Finally we got back in the trees out of the wind and I started warming up.  We made pretty quick time of the trail down and were back at the car and heading out of the park by 2PM.  A quick lunch stop at Bruno's ended a good day.  Although we didn't quite get to climb what we intended, I was happy to get out in the mountains again.
