			<h1>Unicorn 6.19.11</h1>
			
			<p>On our way to the trailhead for the Tatoosh outing during BCC, I had decided that my goal for the year was to get a Tatoosh summit.  We didn’t get Eagle during my BCC class, we didn’t get Eagle or Chutla during the winter when we hiked in, and we didn’t end up getting Pinnacle or Castle this year either.  I also wanted to get Alicia and Alyssa out for an outing to give them a taste of what BCC is like, so they would have a better idea if the class is for them.  BCC is over but BRC was starting right away.  The plan was to hang out in Seattle on Saturday for the Fremont Fair, then head to Leavenworth that afternoon to join up with the class and do some climbing on Sunday.  I talked to Aaron P about what Tatoosh climbs I should try and he suggested Unicorn, a fairly straightforward peak with a little rock climb pitch at the top.  I checked out the SummitPost descriptions for Unicorn and Castle/Pinnacle.  Unicorn sounded fun and a peak not many of my friends had done so I settled on that.  Part of the description mentioned the scree field that would require crossing once the snow melted.  Scree field – doesn’t sound like fun so I decided I wanted to do the climb before the snow was gone.  After a quick look at my calendar that narrowed it down to that coming weekend on Sunday as my only opportunity.  I was planning to be in Leavenworth the following weekend anyways so I figured not going Sunday would be OK.  I e-mailed out a few friends to see if anyone would be interested in helping me take Alicia and Alyssa out – including Alicia and Alyssa.  A lot of people had other plans and there were injuries so I hadn’t heard much and decided to bring the climb to Bag-It Night.  It’s a Boealps event where people bring climbs they’re going to lead over the summer and other people can sign up to go on them.  It was perfect timing – decide on a climb Monday, go to Bag-It Night Wednesday, and climb Unicorn on Sunday.  By Bag-It Night both Alicia and Sara had been convinced to come on my adventure.  I limited the sign-up sheet to 6 as I was looking for 6 – 8 people.  After Dr. Luks’s altitude talk, the sign-up sheets were out.  By the end of the night I had gathered names from 8 individuals on my sheet – plus Alicia, Sara, and myself.  11 total, more than I wanted but less than the party limit size.  I decided to go with everyone and bring two ropes and forewarn everyone to expect to be waiting around a bit at the top.
			</p>
			<p>
			I got the contact information for the group Friday morning and sent out a planning e-mail since there wasn’t much time before the climb.  I had talked to Aaron about the route to the summit and decided to try and lead the 5.6 route at the top – with the 5.0 as a backup/second route.  People volunteered to bring pieces of the group’s emergency gear and carpools were formed.  The weather for the weekend wasn’t great but it was partly sunny on Sunday for our climb – until Saturday.  Then the forecast changed to 40% chance of precipitation.  I e-mailed the group about the weather, requesting they let me know if they wanted to opt out due to weather.  I had three quick opt-out responses and a couple others on the fence so I wasn’t sure if the climb would still be a go.  We met at the 65th park and ride at 5:50am on Sunday and had the remaining 8 show up – I was excited!  We loaded into two cars and started the drive down to Mt Rainier.  We divied up a little bit of the gear at the trailhead to Snow Lake and started out.  I had spent a little time in Google Earth the night before picking out a few key waypoints along the way, to make sure we stayed on track – the trailhead, Bench Lake, Snow Lake, the top and bottom of the gully, and the saddle.  There were several cars at the trailhead and some bootpack established so we followed that most of the way.
			</p>
			<p>
			We were soon passing what looked like Bench Lake – at least according to my waypoint, and were soon near Snow Lake.  We took a quick <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14667">break</a> to de-layer and grab ice axes.  We continued along <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14666">Snow Lake</a>, following the boot pack, to the base of the gully.  I had somehow managed to fill my pack to the weight equivalent of my normal overnight pack – 30lbs.  I didn’t really have much with me but I did have a bunch of my rock gear – alpine draws and my trad rack included.  The pack was weighing heavy on my back so Sara volunteered to take some gear and ended up with my trad rack.  That was a big help!  I dropped from the front of the group to the back and Sara started <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14665">leading</a> the group up the gully.  We had a mini <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14664">lesson</a> for Alicia on how to use her ice axe and away we <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14662">went</a>.  We soon reached the top of the gully and took a quick break.  I stayed at the end and dropped about 30 feet behind the group as we made our way towards the saddle.  We found another more flat area so we took another break.  After that I had recovered enough/had more energy so I stayed with the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14661">group</a> up to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14660">Saddle</a>.  After a quick decision we decided to stay southeast and find our way over to the summit.  Turns out we should have gone northeast for a little shorter route but nothing was lost and we arrived at the summit block.
			</p>
			<p>
			When we were hiking along Snow Lake we saw a rather large group ascending the gully.  I wasn’t too pleased as I didn’t know how that would limit the rock climbs at the top.  When we arrived the group was setting up ropes on the 5.0, the 5.6 was open for me to lead!  The group turned out to be members of Mazama, the main climbing organization down in Oregon.  They were really nice and the lead pointed out the 5.6 route to me.  I geared up and put my rock shoes on.  I didn’t feel comfortable trying to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14655">lead</a> in my boots as this was only my second Trad lead and my first 5.6.  Sara was lead belaying me and then hanging out down low to make sure everyone did alright getting up the route.  Alicia was going to follow me.  Originally I was going to have her bring up the extra rope for the 5.0 route but the Mazamas were on that so we just stuck to the 5.6.  They did offer us use of their ropes on that route for a few members of the group which was really nice.
			</p>
			<p>
			I was geared up and ready to take on the climb.  Unfortunately the weather wasn’t great so I had flashbacks to Vantage in March and cold hands.  I warned Sara that I’d probably take a few times to warm them as I went.  I looked to see if I could protect the first move but that wasn’t really possible so up I went.  Getting up to the first ledge was by far the most difficult part of the climb.  Once I got up and placed my first piece of gear, I took a break to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14656">warm</a> my hands.  The route had great ledges every little bit for placing gear from, the only problem was that the cracks weren’t great for taking gear.  Every ledge I’d look around for quite a while to find a suitable area to place something.  I placed the .3 cam as my first piece – thankful to have that little guy as that climb was my first opportunity to use it.  My next piece was the #6 nut which I placed a little too well.  I got to another spot that I wanted to protect but it was a bit awkward.  I had a hold with my left hand and as I started looking around I spotted the old piton to my right!  I got very happy and was more than glad to clip that piece as I continued up.  I placed one more cam, a .75, and then spent time trying to find one more placement at the large <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14654">ledge</a> just below the top.  I finally decided it wasn’t worth it as it was an easy section and I just finished the climb.  The large boulder was in use as an anchor for the 5.0 route and the gnarled tree was slung for the rappel, so I had to walk quite a ways across the summit block towards the true summit before I found a good area to build an anchor.  I first found this great rock.  I tried moving it and it didn’t budge so I slung that as my first piece.  I ended up placing two nuts in two different horizontal cracks to finish out the anchor, a 5 and 7.  I grabbed my cordelette and finished setting up the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14648">anchor</a>.  My plan was to have everyone top rope off of that so I pulled up most of the rope and threw it down for Alicia to follow.
			</p>
			<p>
			Alicia had a difficult time with the first couple of moves as well – that’s what we short people get I guess.  She flew up the rest of the route minus trying to get the nut – I had wedged it way too well and she wasn’t able to free it. She took the sling but left the nut tool attached so that those following could try to free it as well.  She made it up to the summit block no problem and she pulled up more of the rope to send it back down for the next climber.  She checked over my anchor and then we got <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14653">summit</a> pictures.  There was a deep, white abyss just out from the summit thanks to the clouds shrouding us.  After Alicia climbed, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14651">Fred</a> tackled the summit block in his boots.  After him came <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14649">Chuck</a>, then <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14647">Sara D</a>, followed by <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14643">Joe</a>, then <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14638">Tobias</a>, and finally <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14636">Sara K</a>.  All the guys climbed in their boots while the girls chose to don the rock shoes.  I was really proud that everyone made it up, considering only half the group regularly rock climbs!  We set Alicia up to belay Sara up to the summit and soon Sara appeared over the final big ledge – with my nut in hand!  She was able to get a better angle to pull that thing out – although it was definitely a feat of finesse to move the nut in just the right pattern to free it.  Once on the summit, Sara K grabbed her Father’s Day <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14635">sign</a> and we got a few pictures, including a successful <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14633">group</a> shot atop the summit, before setting up the rappel from the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14630">gnarled tree</a>.  There were 3 slings and one cord slung around the tree, all looking to be in very good condition with the rap rings.  We sent the rope down and sent <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14631">Sara K</a> first.  She was able to get rid of the big knot in one of the rope strands so that the team could follow her down.  I was last on the summit block and was happy to be heading back down as the weather had gotten even worse – considering my rock shoes aren’t very water repellant.

			Fred had shared Reese’s cups as a summit treat and Joe also had chocolate for the team.  I had brought sno cone supplies but it wasn’t really sno cone weather so we didn’t have those.  After we got the rock gear off and the mountain gear back on, we were on our way.  We found our way around the sub summit and started the glissades down.  First down to the saddle, and then <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14621">down</a> from there to the base of the gully.  We stopped a couple times to walk across the flatter areas but most of the elevation down we glissaded.  I sure got going fast on my rain pants!  Unfortunately I lot my blue sippy cup water bottle during the last part of the glissade.  We had our end in sight though, we just had to do the relatively flat mile past the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14620">lakes</a> and to the trailhead.  We made pretty good time and even decided on Bruno’s for post climbing dinner.  We were back at the cars and in Eatonville enjoying a well deserved meal before we knew it.  Our waiter had even mentioned the crazy crew dragging a keg up to Muir – not knowing our group contained a few of those crazies.  My how the stories travel!  Despite the weather, it was a great climb.  It was my first alpine climb and successful lead.  Everyone made it up the 5.6 to the summit and down safely which I consider a success.  Not bad for my first Tatoosh summit!</p>
