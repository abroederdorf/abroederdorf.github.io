			<h1>Index - Lower Town Wall - Great Northern Slab 8.28.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			The guys were planning a trip to Paisano over labor day weekend so they wanted to get some more challenging leading in since they had been helping us learn to lead on easier stuff all summer.  They decided on a day at Index.  We left Seattle at 7AM with a stop for breakfast at the Sultan Bakery.  Aaron and I split a breakfast while Sara and Matt decided to challenge the breakfast sandwiches.  I don't think I've ever seen such a large sandwich!  We made a quick stop in the thriving town of Index and had a little fun on the playground before making our way out to the climbing area. </p>

			We pulled into the parking lot to find three other cars there.  We grabbed out stuff and made the long 3 min trek across the tracks to Great Northern Slab.  Aaron and I were starting on Aires while Matt and Sara started on Great Northern Slab.  Aaron lead the first pitch of Aires, the 5.8 off width crack.  I struggled up after him, not being able to do an arm jam.  Good thing I was on top rope.  </p>

			I took the second pitch of Aires and lead up the 5.8 finger crack.  I placed lots of little gear and built an anchor at the end.  Aaron took the third pitch, a climb up Pisces, a nice 5.6 hand crack.  </p>

			Aaron set up an anchor at the confusing rappel station with four bolts and chains, and belayed me up.  We decided to do the last pitch of Great Northern Slab and I took the lead on the 5.6.  I found a nice horn to sling right away, then a tree, and another root.  I love finding natural pro.  After that I went up the slabby face.  It was a bit thin but not bad.  I anchored into the rappel station and brought Aaron up, with Matt following close behind.  Matt belayed Sara up and we started the rappels.  Sara was first down with a gun sling so that we didn't throw the rope down on the climbers behind us. </p>

			I was the last to rappel down and join the party at the crazy rappel station.  Matt and Aaron rappelled down as I started to pull the rope.  Sara was about to head down when I noticed the rope had gotten hung up on a big horn climbers right of the tree above us.  Since the boys were off the rappel, Sara tied into that rope and I started to belay her up.  Unfortunately that rope had also gotten stuck, leaving Sara about a foot short, so Aaron scrambled down below to free it.  Finally she reached the stuck rope, downclimbed, and rappelled down to the huge bolts.  I was last down and was able to work my way over to the large bolts.  I lead off the final rappel and was soon back on the ground.  We left the rope up on the third rappel to play on the 5.10+, Sandy Corner.  Matt took on the corner finger crack first, followed by Sara and Aaron.  </p>

			I was last and started with a lieback, having a hard time with the last move to the top.  Finally I made it and we regrouped.  Matt had wanted to do Princely Ambitions while Aaron wanted to climb Godzilla.  </p>

			There were people on both routes and the guys were a bit tired so we decided to head back towards Great Northern Slab and explore a trail nearby.  After winding our way up we came to another section of the wall, void of climbers but sporting a few bolts - both new and old. </p>

			It was about 2PM in the afternoon so we decided to head back to Seattle with an ice cream stop in Monroe on the way.  It was a fun first outing at Index for me.</p>
