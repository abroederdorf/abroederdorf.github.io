			<h1>Wenatchee Rafting with BEWET 6.25.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			With busy summer schedules, I had picked the last BEWET trip on the Wenatchee.  I gathered a group for some rafting on Saturday and climbing the rest of the time.  Sara, Alicia, Alyssa, Danielle, Kevin, and myself would be in one <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14802">boat</a>.  Carla and Karan were joining on another boat, and Aaron and Matt were going to run up into the Enchantments and tag a couple of peaks instead of rafting.  Aaron, Alicia, and I drove out early to get some climbing in Friday afternoon before meeting with Sara, Matt, and Kevin for dinner in downtown Leavenworth.  We set up camp at the private site along Icicle Creek, talked around the campfire a little bit, and hit the hay. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The alarm went off at 2AM for Aaron and Matt to get up and going – they were expecting a long day of climbing ahead for their adventure.  The rest of us woke up about 7:30AM and started getting ready for a day on the river.  Kevin went into town to rent wet suits with Karan and Carla.  The rest of us started getting some breakfast and lathering up with sunscreen.  The guides started getting the boats ready about 8AM and we were supposed to report in around 9AM.  Danielle and Alyssa arrived that morning and we designated them and Carla as the drivers for our group.  The boys had to take a car for their climbing adventure so they took mine, and we piled the remaining climbing gear and other camping essentials (food and beer) into Sara’s so it was a bit full.  We sat around chit chatting while the drivers drove to Cashmere – the take out – and shuttled back.  We grabbed life vests, listened to the safety lecture, and got our boat assignments.  We managed to snag our own boat with Josh as our guide – it was going to be a fun time on the river.
			</p>
			<p>
			We put in with <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14800">Kevin and Sara</a> in the front, Alicia and Danielle in the middle, and Alyssa and I in the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14799">back</a>.  Josh soon rearranged – after a few seat swaps and a new nickname – so that Danielle and I switched positions.  It was a nice sunny day so I started with the farmer jane wetsuit, new booties, and the rash guard I had gotten for Hawaii.  We worked through our paddling commands so that Josh could figure out how to best work with us (we had a little trouble with the whole paddle together thing).  We floated nice and easy, as always, down Icicle Creek until we met up with the Wenatchee – let the real fun begin!
			</p>
			<p>
			With all of the late season snow, the river was running at a really good level with lots of fun water.  Josh did a great job of making sure the right side of the boat got splashed a lot – Sara, myself, and Danielle.  It was pretty nice out but not quite warm enough with the breeze.  We went through a few rapids and pulled out at the weir as normal.  I decided it was time to try out my new splash jacket – what a good choice!  It definitely kept me dry and warm.  We had a good time of telling jokes and stories as we made our way down the river.  We talked about the great apple juice pipeline incident in the 1980’s and about how to rappel in brides from helicopters – not sure where that one came from?  The rapids after lunch were fun and there was a lot more action on the river.  Sara pulled her <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14790">Go-Pro</a> out to get some action shots of heading into the rapids.  Luckily we soon pulled over at a little island to grab lunch as my stomach was empty.  We tried warming up shivering Danielle – mostly by Alyssa insisting she take a bunch of her clothing since she had been fairly dry and stayed warm during the morning.  The girls also took advantage of Kevin’s great <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14791">heat</a> output abilities.  Everyone got some food in their stomachs and we were off on the river again.
			</p>
			<p>
			We had a fun, uneventful (read: no swimmers) as we continued down the river.  Before we knew it we were in Cashmere and at the take out.  We helped break down the boat grabbing all of the lines, drying it off, and deflating it to get the truck packed up again.  Then it was back to Osprey to return the wet suits and back to camp to get ready for a little climbing.  We were pleasantly surprised to find the boys sitting in camp – their adventure had only taken a little over 10 hours!  We talked a little and headed for the crags to get a little climbing in before the potluck dinner.  We returned to a mostly completed potluck – the food spread out with lots of good treats.  Sara started grilling up the sausage as the rest of us grabbed some beer.  We divied up the sausage two per person and grabbed some other treats (someone brought tootsie rolls and bubble gum!).  After the food got mostly cleaned up, we grabbed our <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14785">chairs</a> and headed for the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14782">fire</a> on the peninsula.  There was a great big group enjoying the evening, including a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14788">cigars</a> that got pulled out.  We sat around the fire chit chatting late into the night, and after the glo sticks came out, I finally retired – I had a day of climbing ahead of me!  It was a great first trip on the river for the year.  I’m definitely happy with the gear I got and can’t wait for the next trip!  Unfortunately that probably won’t be until the Tieton in September, unless we can find some time away from the rock before that.
