			<h1>Vantage - Sunshine Wall 10.23.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			The weather forecast didn’t look very good for most of WA but there was one sunny spot over Vantage so we decided to do some rock climbing – and I thought my outdoor season was over.  The Northwest Chocolate Festival also happened to be taking place that weekend, so we decided to just climb one day.  Saturday morning we ventured down to the Seattle Center and tasted more chocolate than we could handle.  Afterwards we rested a bit before packing up and heading to Vantage.  We set up camp at dusk on the north side of the Feathers, and after getting settled in, ventured up to the Feathers for a bit of scrambling.  We scrambled up near Satan’s Pillar and enjoyed the meteor shower above.  We ventured down so that the boys could do some night climbing, while the girls got the fire started.  We had fun talking back and forth via radio and yelling from the rock with the climbers.  The fire burned quickly so we were soon tucked in for the night – not expecting the windstorm that night.  We had everything staked down but woke up to the wind and flapping tents several times, as well as a layer of dirt covering everything in the morning.

			After getting some breakfast, we packed up and headed down the road a little to the parking lot near the Sunshine Wall, just south of the feathers.  Matt, Aaron N, and Alicia got a little climbing in at the Feathers before joining us.  Alyssa and I followed Aaron P down one of the gullies and to our first routes of the weekend.  I got setup to lead <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/chapstick/107030843">Chapstick</a>, a 5.6, while Alyssa got ready to belay me up.  It was a fun route with small  cracks that I ran out the last 30 feet+ or so (over blocky ledges).  Alyssa cleaned the route for me as the rest of the group found us.

			Alicia led Chapstick (5.6) next and cleaned as she lowered, while Aaron N put up <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D">Another Notch in my Lipstick Case</a> (5.7) just on the other side of the column.  Alicia, Alyssa, and I all took turns top roping that before joining the boys further down the wall.  It was a fun, stemming sort of problem that I was happy not to have led.</p>
			<p>
			The boys were just finishing up top roping a long 5.10b finger crack route with several bulges, Crackmaster Lambada.  We grabbed the bagels and lunch food as they finished, to make some sandwiches, and then Alicia and I each took a turn top roping the route as well.

			It was really long and tiring and I had to take several breaks.  After that Aaron N. decided he wanted to lead another 5.10b nearby, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9D">Boschido</a>.  This route was 13 bolts on the face of a column with lots of good holds.  Everyone was about ready to go home so I volunteered to clean the route.

			It was another very long route with a few more places for rests in my opinion – I don’t think I took quite as many breaks at least.  I cleaned the route, rappelled down, and we finished packing up to head for the cars.  Aaron P wanted to head back to the cars a different way from the gully we took on the way to the rock so we started down the path, and after asking for a little help, finally found the slot like canyon to get back to the path.  It was a fun little trail through the rock.

			After a few group pictures we headed up the trail and started back to the cars.  It was a great day of late season climbing, and a good first experience at the Sunshine Wall area.
