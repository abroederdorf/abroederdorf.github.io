			<h1>Leavenworth Cragging 6.24 - 6.26.11</h1>
			
			<p>
			I had figured out a good weekend for a rafting trip down the Wenatchee with BEWET.  Of course I planned to climb when I wasn’t on the river.  I mean we would be in Leavenworth – how can you not?  We signed up to raft on Saturday which meant I had Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday for climbing – yippee!  I convinced Aaron P and Alicia to take off work Friday afternoon and head to Leavenworth to get a couple climbs in.  I’ve never been to Mountaineer’s Dome but there a couple good beginning trad climbs there, so Alicia and I planned to climb those.  We left the park and ride in Bothell at 2:16 and arrived at the rock in Leavenworth about 4:30.  Alicia and I quickly changed into climbing clothes and grabbed our stuff as a truck with a few guys pulled up behind us.  We didn’t want them snagging the routes before us.  I <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14777">racked</a> up and took the first <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14775">lead</a> on the 5.4, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14773">Right Crack</a>.  Alicia belayed me as Aaron watched.  He was able to scramble up the side a bit which was nice because I could ask him some questions as I was placing gear – a great learning opportunity.  I tend to place nuts if I can, only reaching for cams when I can’t.  I did a good a fairly good job of sewing up the route and was soon at the bolted anchor.  I cleaned as I lowered so that Alicia could lead the route after me.  I placed a nut a little too well again (apparently that’s my MO?) so Aaron found me a rock so that I could dislodge the nut.  Alicia <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14772">lead</a> it no problem after me.  It was fun seeing what <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14770">she</a> placed so I could learn more.  Next I lead the 5.6, Left Crack.  The start is interesting as you’re precariously standing on rock near the tree.  I started up the crack and placed a couple pieces of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14764">gear</a>, running out a bit between the second and third piece – not the smartest move but the crack was too far over for me to see anything to place gear.  I finally placed another couple pieces and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14762">finished</a> off the route.  Alicia followed and cleaned – no stuck nuts!  We gathered the gear up and drove into town to meet Sara, Matt, and Kevin for some dinner at Andreas Keller.

			After dinner we went to the private campsite BEWET uses for the weekend and set up tents.  Aaron and Matt were planning to climb Dragontail and Colchuck in the enchantments the next day so they were waking up at 2AM to get climbing by 3AM in anticipation of a 16 hour day.  Since they had an early wake up call they went to bed right away while the rest of us found our way over to the fire on the peninsula to hang out for a bit before going to sleep.  My watch went off at 2AM and Aaron was soon gone, leaving me to sleep until 7:30AM when I needed to get ready for rafting.  We had a great day on the river and were back in camp sometime between 4 and 5.  We were pleasantly surprised to find the boys sitting in camp, having only taken 10.5 hours for their climbing <a href="http://cascadeclimbers.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=1024113">adventure</a>.  We quickly changed, talked about possible crags and took off.  Melissa was on the river for the weekend so she joined us and we even talked Danielle into coming – luckily I had planned on that and brought my sport harness and both pairs of shoes.  We ended up at <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14760">XY crag</a> while Matt and Sara took a detour to Roto Wall so that Sara could finally lead those routes.  I lead the 5.7 X crack with the left finish – definitely the most challenging trad lead yet!  The crack was very large and I had soon used my 1, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14758">2</a>, and 3 cams.  I did manage to place a nut but the cracks were soon petering out, leaving me with some tricky moves to pull on lead.  I was doing a great job of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14753">jamming</a> hands/arms and feet into the cracks while I had them.  I finally pulled the final move to the top and set up an anchor.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14740">Melissa</a> followed me and cleaned, with <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14731">Kevin</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14728">Danielle</a> climbing after her.  Danielle did a great job of climbing the cracks (this was her second ever rock climb) and even pulled some lie back moves near the top.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14742">Alicia</a>, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14737">Alyssa</a>, and Melissa were also attacking the 5.10a just right of the X crack.  There was a tricky undercling leading to the crack that presented a good challenge for all.  The final climb was a race between Sara on the X crack and Kevin on the 5.10a to see who would make it to the top first, loser having to clean the anchors and walk down.  It was close with Kevin just pulling out ahead.  We went back to camp and cooked up some sausage for the group at the potluck, enjoying some of the treats that were brought.  I went to bed not too late to get some sleep before fun day Sunday – more rock climbing!
			</p>

			The plan for Sunday was to head to Clamshell Cave for some more trad leading.  I had never been there so I was excited.  We actually woke up around 7:30AM, cleaned up camp, and were on the road by 9:15.  We hiked up to Clamshell Cave and were surprised to find we were the only ones there.  Matt and Aaron set a rope on the cube with a challenging 5.8 crack that tried to get the best of Kevin, Sara, and Alyssa.  Alicia and I headed up to do some leading.  I started on the 5.7+ <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14723">Shrimp Salad</a>.  It was an interesting route.  I placed a number 3 <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14724">deep</a> in the crack to start and had to do some little chimney moves to get myself out of it and back on the face to continue climbing.  There was a great horizontal crack that I plugged with a #1 cam, and then I slung the old tree stump.  From there I made my way up to the ramp, making sure to extend my slings to reduce rope drag – although there was still lots of that.  I made it up to the top, set up anchor on the bolts and lowered down – grabbing once piece from the ramp to try and help reduce the rope drag, I should have grabbed one more though.  Lessons learned for the future.  Alicia followed and cleaned the route, contemplating trying the 5.10a variation at the top.  Sara and Alyssa climbed after her and moved the rope over to a 5.8, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14715">Keep Clam</a>.  I lead another 5.7 to the left, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14714">Noisy Oyster</a>.  I felt really solid on that route and enjoyed it.  I started by slinging a tree and then worked my way up the crack, using some good foot jams.  I did a better job of placing protection to make sure I didn’t run anything out too much.  I soon ran out of crack and was faced with a slabby bit and two bolts.  This was definitely the most challenging part of the climb for me.  I made it up, placed one more piece, and found my way over to the bolts to set up another anchor.  It was nice and sunny and everyone was soaking it up – lots of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14713">shirtless</a> climbers not even pebble <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14712">wrestling</a>.  I took my turn on the top rope 5.8 and had fun – it was like climbing a ladder, new cracks appeared right when you needed them.  I headed down to the packs to grab food and water as Aaron and Matt raced up the 5.7 and 5.8 respectively to clean the routes and set up some new ones in another area at Clamshell.
			</p>
			<p>
			There’s the long 5.7 <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14711">Clamshell Crack</a> that the guys dropped a rope on, while Matt decided to try <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14705">leading</a> the nearby 5.9 Forty-Four Fifty.  Sara and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14704">Alicia</a> both top roped the 5.7 and then I took my <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14702">turn</a>.  Aaron had thought about having me lead it but I was fine just top roping it.  It was a good climb but the first section and last section were difficult – I’m not sure how leading it would have been.  Maybe another time as I keep climbing and hopefully improving.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14694">Kevin</a> climbed the route after me and just reached the top as Matt reached the top of his climb.  Matt had picked a challenging 5.9 that was a mix of slabby sport and trad cracks.  I was elected to clean the route which Sara was gracious enough to give me a friendly belay on.  Matt had the challenge of trying to reach the upper crack on the route so I knew I’d definitely have a challenge since I’m a few inches shorter.  I made my way up the slabby section, happy not to be leading it, and soon found myself on the ledge.  The next challenge was getting up to that crack.  I went out wide to get up on a flake and soon found myself climbing up the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14689">crack</a>.  Once at the top I grabbed the one anchor and then rappelled down.  It was nice and hot and we had a long weekend so we decided to head into town to get some sausages and pretzels at the sausage stand before heading home.  It was a great weekend of rafting and climbing and I had a lot of fun getting a few more leads under my belt.</p>
