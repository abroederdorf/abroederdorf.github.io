			<h1>Leavenworth 4.29 - 5.1.11</h1>
			
			<p>After a great weekend of rock climbing in Vantage, it was time for the BCC to go to Leavenworth, which means Boealps spring campout!  I was excited for my second weekend of rock climbing, especially after having so much fun in Vantage.  Aaron, Kevin, and I left the Bothell park and ride a few minutes before 3 - yea, we were ahead of schedule!  After a stop at the gas station to pick up some goodies (like a Snickers ice cream bar, gatorade, and other assorted candy) we were on our way to Leavenworth.  We arrived, set up camp, and went to Roto Wall.  I was going to get my first trad lead and Kevin was going to get his first outdoor climb/lead belay/trad follow - quite the climb! Aaron helped <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14246">Kevin</a> get started with lead belaying as I <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14249">placed</a> my first few pieces on the far left crack.  I put a lot in for practice and I had fun.  My <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14247">confidence</a> in the gear definitely grew as I placed <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14244">more</a> and tested them.  Aaron had walked up to the top so that he could help me with the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14242">anchor</a>.  We used the bolt and I placed another two pieces of gear to get my 3, then Aaron showed me how to use my shiny new, blue cordelette.  To get some practice for Saturday, I then <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14238">belayed</a> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14240">Kevin</a> up to act as a mini-multi pitch.  We rappelled down (I'm lazy and prefer that to walking) and then met Sara, Alicia, and Matt in town for some good German food.
			</p>
			<p>
			Saturday morning didn't start out nearly as well as Friday night went.  I woke up about 4AM and had a hard time trying to get back to sleep, I wasn't feeling good.  When Aaron woke up around 7 to get going and asked me if I was excited (we were going to be doing R&amp;D - my first multipitch!) I replied by yaking in the vestibule.  Great start to the morning.  I was not feeling good (obviously) but didn't want to just give up on R&amp;D so I got ready and said we'd play it by ear.  Aaron reminded me that once we started we were committed, so I was going to wait until the very last moment to decide.  To give myself a chance to settle down, I asked if <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14232">Matt and Sara</a> would start.  Dana and Josh were to have started earlier around 7:30 and Aaron N and Evelyne were also climbing.  Due to a mix up with finding the start of the climb, <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14231">Matt</a> started out on the traditional route just ahead of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14229">Evelyne</a> starting a little lower on a large slab section.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14226">Dana and Josh</a> went a little left of us and Dana started up - all three groups starting relatively at the same time on three different routes.  Once Matt had set the anchor and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14224">Sara</a> started following, Aaron started leading the first pitch.  I had the backpack with our shoes, puffys, snacks, and water.  It was a bit cold so I kept my hiking socks on with my rock shoes - something I figured out I could do at the first Vantage trip in March.  Aaron made quick work of the route, heading off a little different from Matt and setting up the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14220">anchor</a> near <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14219">Evelyne</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14221">Aaron N</a>.  I had led my first trad climb Friday night, and I was now getting to follow my first trad climb Saturday morning.  The climb went well despite having to stop a couple times due to feeling awful.  Aaron was thinking of trying to get me to lead a little but after how bad I felt during the first pitch, I opted to follow for the day.  I didn't want to get in a sketchy situation with not feeling well.
			</p>
			<p>
			After the first pitch, basically all of the teams converged for the next - the theme of the day.  Climb fast and then wait a long time.  We had started out early in the morning to avoid the congestion and there were a couple group behind us, but we just had too many groups climbing at basically the same time.  After Aaron N set anchor and Evelyne started <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14217">following</a>, Aaron P started out on the second pitch from the huge boulder he slung for the anchor.  The second pitch was relatively easy and within my ability - future mental note.  I had a tough time with one of the cams he placed but after quite the effort, I finally freed it from the rock.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14216">Matt and Sara</a> were anchored right by Aaron so <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14215">we</a> chatted while Evelyne led the third pitch up the chimney with Aaron N following.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14218">Dana</a> decided to try the alternate route up Cocaine Crack, a 10.a.  After getting a couple pieces up, he decided it wasn't the day for that crack and downclimbed, leaving one piece and sling <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14213">blowing</a> in the wind.  He went left and up, and eventually rappelled <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14208">down</a> to rescue his gear.  The two groups behind us had caught up and were unhappily sitting near us.  There weren't many places for building <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14207">anchors</a> so they were none to happy.  It's not hard to figure out to wait a bit after the gathering at the beginning of the second pitch, oh well.  The couple guys right behind us were a bit ridiculous and I feel imminent disaster is in their future - not the smartest climbers I've come across.  Aaron led the third pitch up the chimney and I was soon following, so far the most difficult pitch of the climb.   I had gotten stuck with my pack in one spot on the first pitch, so the chimney proved very formidable.  After avoiding the wet slime on a few rocks, I was up in the chimney and soon emerging to the next group gathering to head up one of the three cracks.  Aaron found a nice little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14204">sheltered</a> place covered by an overhang, a little more out of the wind.  The wind was pretty cold so I had actually done the second and third pitch in my puffy.  It was a day of climbing in <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14159">puffys</a> for most of our group.  The sunshine looked so <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14201">inviting</a> but the wind was mean.
			</p>
			<p>
			We waited our turn as Aaron N led the fourth pitch and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14202">Dana</a> started.  Dana went left again but climbed right <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14200">overtop</a> of us on his way.  Matt and Sara went up right, tired of waiting as well.  I watched as Aaron placed some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14193">gear</a> and climbed the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14191">crack</a>, before <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14189">disappearing</a> above.  I gathered up the anchor and started following.  The first move on the pitch was a challenge - it was just a really high step for me.  I got up to the crack and thought I was going to get blown off - the wind was ridiculous!  It felt like I had a firehose of air on me, I was glad to be following.  I got up the crack and joined Aaron again.  The fourth pitch was to be the last to get us to the top, but due to the traffic jam he had to set up an anchor a little early.  Once Dana and Josh were passed us, Aaron continued up.  As I was waiting Matt came up to chat so that he could get going as soon as possible to escape the wind.  The old guy following us also came up and decided it was a good idea to sit on my foot - yea, he was a class act.  I was glad when Aaron set up anchor and I got to escape.  The impromptu fifth pitch wasn't too bad, a bit more crack climbing but at least not quite as windy as the crack climb on the fourth pitch.  I made it to the top - first multi-pitch climb was a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14188">success</a>!  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14184">Matt and Sara</a> were close behind and we made our way <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14181">down</a> to the road.  Alicia, Alyssa, and Kevin had finished climbing and parked at the base of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14178">R&amp;D</a> to wait for us.  I saw them pull up while I was belaying Aaron on the fourth pitch.
			</p>
			<p>
			We went back to the camp site and grabbed some food.  Then a pretty large <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14168">group</a> of us headed for Classic Crack at 8-Mile <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14175">Rock</a>.  Some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14177">top ropes</a> were put up and everyone took turns <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14174">climbing</a>, an easy-does-it evening of climbing.   I started off on Mickey Mantle, a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14172">5.7</a>, and then did Deception Crack, a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14163">5.9</a>.  The 5.7 wasn't too bad, a lot of slab climbing so my new shoes made it a little interesting.  I haven't quite gotten comfortable with them and didn't trust them completely.  The 5.9 crack worked me.  I had a little skin left on my hands afterwards - the crack was not nice.  It was an odd width that didn't fit my hand or fist well, it was in between.  It started getting cold and people started getting hungry so we went back to the campsite, then drove into town to pick up some food for the potluck that night.  On our way back Aaron got a call about a climbing accident involving a few people from out team, so he went back into town to the hospital to check on them and figure out a plan.  Luckily they both walked out from the accident, with some severe injuries but there could have been an even worse outcome.  Still not feeling the greatest throughout the day, I went to bed early in hopes of a better Sunday for our outing.

			Sunday Team Fuster Cluck was headed to Madsen's Buttress for our day - right across the street from the Snow Lake parking lot.  We followed the trail up a short ways, passed a nice <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14354">waterfall</a>, and started setting up anchors for the day.  The first part of the morning was spent talking about building anchors and using <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14351">gear</a> - cams, nuts, tri-cams. Looking for <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14349">natural</a> anchors was also discussed - trees, rocks, chocks with natural pinch points.  We got four anchors set up and it was onto the rappelling past a knot demonstration.  I got to do the demonstration while Curtis talked it.  After that the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14336">students</a> all got their turn to rappel past a knot.  I worked on rope three with <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14334">Kevin</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14327">Luke</a>.  They did a great job and both successfully rappelled <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14324">past</a> a knot.  I love using the prusiks to inch up the rope, I think it's fun which is why I volunteered for the demonstration.  Next it was learning to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14321">tie off</a> a fallen climber and escape the belay.  Emily demonstrated while Charlie talked it, and I got to play fallen climber.  Once Emily had gotten out of the belay to check on me and back into it, I decided to climb up.  It was an interesting short section of rock that took an interesting <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14306">mantle</a> in mountaineering boots to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14307">climb</a>.  Sara and Martin were at anchor 4 so they both got to do the climb as well.  It was fun looking at all of the students <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14313">hanging</a> out while their partner above escaped the belay to check on them.  They seemed to be having fun.  We needed one last fallen climbed so <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14302">Aaron N</a> lowered down and had some fun while Sara tried giving him a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14301">cookie</a>.  We flew through the skills and were done with everything but the free rappel so we grabbed some food and people got the chance to do a little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14290">rock</a> climbing.
			</p>
			<p>
			I headed over to the free <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14273">rappel</a> with Ron, Charlie, Emily, Keith, and Martin.  I set up shop a little ways from the rappel so I could see it and take pictures, and help facilitate communication between the top and bottom.  It was a double rope free rappel, one of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14284">longest</a> ones in the area.  Emily was the first one down to help provide a fireman's belay incase any students freaked out and let go of the rope, but they did a great job.  After all of the students had gone, a few instructors got their chance.  Since I was taking pictures, I was the last one to go and down I went with my pack.  From there I continued down to the parking lot since I had my gear while most of the team went back to our original spot to gather everything up.  I found Keith and Martin near the road in some shade (it was actually sunny, a nice weather outing!).  Soon the rest of the team joined us and since we had a couple hours before we were suppose to report to the Snow Lake <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14260">parking lot</a>, we went to Bruce's <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14256">Boulder</a> to let the students try some more rock climbing.  We dropped two ropes down, on the 5.5 slabby route and the 5.9 Arete.  I had tried the 5.9 Arete the previous year on my first day ever of rock climbing.  I had made it about 2/3's up but couldn't complete it, so I was going to do the climb again.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14257">Thai</a> went up first as I belayed, and then we switched.  I climbed it clean and then <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/14252">Keith</a> tried it and did a great job.  Team 6 invaded the rock so we headed to the parking lot to meet up with the rest of the groups so we could leave and grab dinner before heading home.  We stopped at the sausage stand place in Leavenworth and had a tasty meal before starting the long drive back to Seattle.  Despite an unfortunate incident on Saturday and not feeling well, it was a good weekend of climbing.  I really enjoyed my easy trad lead and can't wait to get out this summer and continue climbing!
