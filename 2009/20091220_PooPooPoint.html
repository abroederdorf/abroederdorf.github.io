			<h1>Poo Poo Point 12-20-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			I had one more hike scheduled to reach my last goal of the year, hiking up 10 miles in elevation.  I had about 1000' left to go - piece of cake.  Well, it would have been a piece of cake if I hadn't gotten the flu Friday.  I stayed home from work and lounged around that day, sleeping a lot with a slight fever.  I had two cans of soup, some fruit snacks, a handful of chocolate, and a banana between Friday and Saturday.  Needless to say I was running a little low on energy.  I downed a banana and sandwich before I left for my hike, hoping to get some energy from that.  I had never driven through the downtown portion of <a href="http://www.downtownissaquah.com/modules/pages/index.php?pageid=1">Issaquah</a> and besides the ridiculously slow speed limits, it was really cute!  The trailhead was near the Issaquah high school and I found a very small parking lot just passed that with what looked like a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9867">trail</a>.  There were no signs but after consulting the map on my new <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-DROID-US-EN">phone</a>, it looked correct.  It had been lightly raining so after putting on my rain pants, I hit the trail just before noon.

			Soon after starting, I knew this was going to be a tough hike.  I really was pretty weak still but I was determined to meet my goal.  In my head I figured I would just hike slower  but apparently I only know one speed, so I eventually just started taking a lot of breaks.  After hiking about 0.78 miles, I reached the first real junction.  I had apparently been hiking on the High School trail - appropriately named since it started at Issaquah High School.  I took the fork that listed Poo Poo Point trail as one of the many that direction.  Not even a tenth of a mile later and I came to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9850">junction</a> with Poo Poo Point.  It was this little ratty trail leading to the right but I followed.  Soon the trail entered the woods and became a wider trail that looked more well traveled.

			I found a few nice logs along the way to sit and take a break.  The beginning of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9860">hike</a> was pretty quiet but I finally met a few groups.  I got to an elevation of 1150' (my goal was to reach 1200') and was excited I had made it so far since I had had some serious doubts throughout the whole hike.  The last 50' took forever though because the trail decided to level off, so I had to hike further than I had hoped.  I did encounter a large <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9857">bridge</a> spanning the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9856">cascade falls</a> so I guess the extra distance ended up working out.  Finally the elevation on my GPS read 1200' and I knew that I had hiked up 1000' and reached my <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9855">10 mile</a> goal!  I promptly turned around to head back to my car, and met several groups on the way down.  The early rain and clouds had given way to some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9854">blue</a> in the sky and some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9853">sunshine</a> sneaking through the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9852">trees</a>.  Luckily going down takes so much less effort so I didn't need to take any breaks.  I was glad to get back to the car though and head home.  More rest for me!
