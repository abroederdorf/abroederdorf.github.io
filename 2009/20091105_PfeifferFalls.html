			<h1>Valley View & Pfeiffer Falls 11-5-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			I headed to California for a long weekend and did some camping/hiking there throughout the trip.  After missing a turn off of 101 to get to 1 by about 60 miles (thanks to my great navigational skills) and finding a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9323">gas station</a>, we arrived at the <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=570">Pfeiffer Big Sur</a> state park, set up <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9322">camp</a> at our site – number <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9321">140</a>, and called it a night.  Thursday was a somewhat casual day of hiking.  After waking up around 9:30 AM we explored the nearby campground, searching for the Big Sur river we could hear.  After packing up we drove through the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9311">redwoods</a> to the other side of the park, which we had camped in, for the trailhead of hike number 1 of the day. 
			</p>
			<p>
			There was a fire in the area that has closed the trail directly to Pfeiffer Falls, but there was access to the falls from the <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=25093">Valley View trail</a>.  There were quite a few groups on the short hike.  We decided to head to Valley View first after waiting for a group of guys behind us to pick the fork they were going to embark on.  This junction was about 0.5 miles into the hike.  After another quarter mile we found ourselves at the end of the trail by a bench with a view of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9309">valley</a>.  After a couple of quick pictures we proceeded to head back down the trail and go find the falls.
			</p>
			<p>
			After descending a hundred feet or so down gradual switchbacks, we crossed a little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9316">bridge</a> and found ourselves at the base of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9315">Pfeiffer Falls</a>.  It wasn’t quite the gushing Franklin Falls I had seen the weekend before, but nonetheless a sight to be had – water trickling down a rock face.  After a few more <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9313">pictures</a> we headed back to the car.  Just over 2 miles later I had completed my first California hiking experience and was ready for what the rest of the day had in store for us.

			<a href="http://www.bigsurcalifornia.org/">Big Sur</a> is an interesting area, encompassing beaches along the Pacific Ocean and mountains and forests just inland.  There were quite a few houses along the ocean and there were several little populated areas, mostly towards the north end of the Big Sur area.  There were several state parks and campgrounds nestled in this area and with those businesses had sprung up.  Little centers contained restaurants, gas stations, general stores, and other touristy shops.  It was a nice area with Route 1 winding (very curvy!) along the ocean.  Being from the Midwest, there is always a fascination with the ocean and this trip was no different.  I was enthralled by the waves, drift wood, animals, and giant groups of kelp floating in the ocean.
