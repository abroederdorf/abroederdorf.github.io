			<h1>Maple Pass  Loop 10-24-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			After my encounter with the rain last weekend, I made a trip to REI this week to purchase some rain pants and a new day pack.  My old day pack is fine for summer months when not many pieces of clothing need to be brought for either rain or cold, but Seattle is definitely into fall with the beginnings of winter starting to show.  After much deliberation, I decided on the <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/778451">REI Traverse 30</a> day pack for women.  It has several great organizational pockets, it's blue, eco-friendly, and it has a built in rain cover!  Luckily Saturday was a beautiful day and I did not have to try out any of my new rain gear. The shoulder straps each have an elastic band which I found very handy for my GPS.  When not in use I would just slide it into the strap so it was not bouncing all around, hanging from my neck.  Other than my breath fogging up the screen every so often, it was convenient for quick glances to see my distance and elevation gains.
			</p>
			<p>
			I got a later start then I was hoping for, not leaving Seattle until 7:40 AM.  I had walked to the movie theater in the U District Friday night to see Zombieland with a new pair of shoes I got, bad idea.  After maybe a 1.5 mile walk round trip I had throbbing blisters on both heels.  I was not a happy camper and was scared that I may not be able to hike as I was really looking forward to going hiking in the North Cascades again.  Saturday morning I bandaged my heels well with gauze and lots of tape to keep the gauze in place.  I did a quick test drive of the heels walking up and down the hill I live on and no searing pain was felt so I set out for highway 20, the North Cascades highway.  Google maps told me it would take 3.5 hours to get to the trailhead, and after my many stops along highway 20 for pictures of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9301">waterfalls</a>, google maps predicted correctly (how it knew I would stop for lots of pictures and a quick 0.5 mile hike to the Gorge lookout amazes me).  I was amazed at how beautiful the drive itself was and was resolved that even if I didn't get to do all of the hiking I was planning on  (due to my stupid blisters) I would still consider the day a success just based on the drive.  I kept slamming on the brakes as I would whiz past a beautiful waterfall, hop out of Vinni, run back to the said waterfall with camera in hand, and then take off again for my destination, the Rainy Pass trailhead near mile marker 158 on highway 20.
			</p>
			<p>
			Finally I arrived at the trailhead and started to get ready.  I turned my GPS on to let it acquire the satellite signals, put my boots on, got my music ready, and was about to head out.  Unfortunately the GPS was not locking on to enough satellites but I did not want to wait any longer so I hit the trail, heading to the right to complete the loop in a counterclockwise direction.  Finally after about a half mile or so my GPS found the satellites and I was able to track the rest of my hike.  The first part of the trail was through the trees on a fairly wet and muddy trail.  I emerged from the trees just after the Lake Ann trail junction (about 1.3 miles) to a view of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9291">Lake Ann</a> and surrounding ridgeline with golden larches down the mountainside.  As I progressed on the loop I would eventually be hiking on that ridgeline.  There were a few switchbacks before leveling out, now with views behind and to my right of lots of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9286">snowy covered, jagged mountain peaks</a>.  I met several <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9287">chipmunks</a> on the trail and I think one was challenging me.  He jumped out of the brush, almost on top of my feet, went a few feet down the path, stood on a rock, and faced me.  I guess I eventually won the stand off because he darted off the path with a squeak.
			</p>
			<p>
			About 2.5 miles in (well 2.5 miles from when my GPS started tracking, probably just after 3 miles or close to half way) I met my first groups of people.  All of the people I met were between about 3 and 4 miles, the halfway section.  The trail at this point was all snow with sections of ice, and being the brilliant person that I am, I forgot my trekking poles in the car so it was slow going over the icy patches so I wouldn't slip and fall down the mountain side.  There were <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9289">icicles</a> frozen on many of the rocks, adding to the beauty of the hike.  Half way I cleared the ridgeline in my way to find even more peaks to the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9272">south</a>, I was surrounded on all sides by mountains - just the way I like it.  The golden <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9278">larches</a> were abundant, not only along the trail but on the surrounding mountainsides.  I was glad I got to see some more in non rainy weather.  This was probably my last larch trip of the year.

			After stopping to grab a cliff bar to satisfy my grumbling stomach, I reached the highest point of the hike at about 6900'.  The cliff bar was a cool mint chocolate and complemented the snow I was hiking through, it felt like a mini winter wonderland.  There was a couple at the top and we exchanged photography <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9267">favors</a> for each other to capture the amazing mountain view.  They were really nice and were impressed with my gear, I guess I must look like I know what I'm doing.  The guy even picked up on my <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9263">A&amp;M hat.</a>  I'm always impressed with people that know what the aTm stands for because I don't think I would if I hadn't gone to school there.  I could see the steep <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9266">switchbacks</a> descending from my high up perch so the rest of the hike was quick, smooth sailing.  Again, I wish I would have had my trekking poles to take some load off of my knees but lessons for the future.  I saw <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9248">Rainy Lake</a>. to my right as I descended and finally made it to the flat, paved Rainy Lake trail.  I got to my car, ate a PB&amp;J sandwich (the hiker's feast as I call it) and headed for the Blue Lake trailhead about 5 miles down the road.  As I was pulling out I passed the nice couple from the top and we pleasantly waved to each  other.  Hiking is always fun, a very nice community, exchanging a few words with most people that you pass.

			Overall the Maple Pass Loop hike was great.  It was a lot of fun hiking through the snow and I loved the contrast between the deep blue sky and the white clouds, snowy mountain peaks, and snow on the ground.  This just edges out Cascade Pass for my favorite hike.  I think even during the summer without the snow and golden larches, I would still like this better.  There is 360 degrees of mountains surrounding you and the loop is a bonus so that the entire hike is an adventure with new sights the whole time.

			Since I was planning on doing two hikes, I saved my track log and cleared the data.  Unfortunately the web site I use to upload my data and make pretty graphs will not upload saved track data, only what's currently in my log.  After much time and effort, I was able to create the following graph and map.  Something is better than nothing!
