			<h1>Lake Ingalls 10-17-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			I really wanted to get out and hike but the weather report was not looking so good.  I checked the Snoqualmie region, Northern Cascades, and the South Cascades...everywhere had a 80 - 100% chance for rain.  Despite the bleak forecast, I made up my mind, I was going to hike, maybe just Saturday this weekend instead of Saturday and Sunday.  I had been reading some trip reports from <a href="http://www.wta.org/"> Washington Trails Association</a>  and saw a couple trip reports for Lake Ingalls.  Before this year I had never heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larch">Larch</a> trees.  They are needle trees like pine, except that during the fall their needles turn a bright golden yellow and fall off.  My goal this fall was to find larches, and larches I found.  When I woke up it was pouring, but around the North Bend area (I-90 exits 32 - 34) the rain let up and it was just cloudy.  Lake Ingalls is near Cle Elum, off of exit 85 and down a long dirt road that took me about 40 mins to drive 10ish miles.  There were a lot of potholes and Vinni doesn't have much clearance, so it makes for slow going.  I finally got to the trailhead around 11:30am, setup the new GPS, and took off for the lake.  The hike has a pretty steady elevation gain.  At about 1.5 miles, the trail splits: left to Lake Ingalls and right to Longs Pass.  At about 2 miles, the rain started.  Until then I had spotted a couple small holes in the clouds with blue sky yonder, but it all disappeared.  I put on my new shell and tried covering my pack with my other water resistant jacket which got soaked and is still drying.  I forgot my pack cover, bad day for that.  I made it up to the pass and was welcomed with a wonderland of golden larches through the clouds and rain.  After taking some pictures I decided that I had had enough of hiking through the rain, wind, mud, and snow and decided to turn back to the trailhead.  Someday I'll make it all the way to Lake Ingalls but today was not that day.

			Thanks to my new GPS, I have 'fun' (well fun to me) data to share:</p>
