			<h1>Blue Lake 10-24-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			Since the drive to Maple Pass was so long, and because this hike was on my to-do list for hiking, I headed for Blue Lake after finishing the Maple Pass Loop.  It was a gorgeous day still, my blisters weren't bothering me, and I had a couple hours of daylight.  I was also hoping to see more golden larches.  I sat in the car for a few minutes at the trailhead to warm up and to eat a Cliff Bar for some energy.  Those energy <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/">Cliff Bars</a> are nice!  I had never had one but QFC has them on sale 10/$10 right now so I stocked up. After pausing at the sign at the trailhead to read through things, I bolted to the trail and started at a nice brisk pace.  At one point my moving speed average was 3.8 miles!  After the fact that I had already hiked 7+ miles set in and my legs felt a little sore, I let up on the pace.

			<p>
			The first mile of the hike was through the trees.  I believe the trailhead for Blue Lake is at a higher elevation than Maple Pass because I hiked through <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9178">snow</a> the entire time.  I passed one group of guys going up while in the trees and met another family coming down in the clearing at one mile.  The clearing provided the first view of the surrounding mountains, and what a treat!  There were plenty more golden larches on the mountainsides and I could see that I would be hiking along some as well.  There were some great rocky peaks contrasted against the deep blue sky.  I believe one of the peaks is known as <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9182">Liberty Bell</a>.  After hiking through the avalanche clearing, it was back to the trees with a little bit more elevation gain.
			</p>
			<p>
			About 0.5 miles from Blue Lake I emerged from the trees again to views of the surrounding <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9159#9175">mountains</a> and golden larch trees.  I took several more pictures, tried not to slip too much on a few icy patches, and found myself at the creek running from Blue Lake.  There was a nice <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9167">log</a> across the creek so I carefully walked across that and arrived at Blue Lake.  I wish the lake were a little more calm for some nice reflection pictures, but the scene was still <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9166">picturesque</a>.  The lake had a backdrop  of mountains with a light dusting of snow.  After a couple of pictures, I decided to head back down instead of further exploring the lake.  It had been a long day of hiking already and I was ready to go back to Seattle.  I took my time on the way down and passed a family.  At the trailhead, I got a couple pictures of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9161">sunset</a> reflecting off of the clouds. I was hoping for some more sunset picture opportunities as I drove home but the sun quickly set and I was driving in the dark.  After a pit stop in Darrington for some gas, both for Vinni (unleaded) and me (Mt Dew, Skittles, and cookies) I made it back to Seattle about 9:00 PM.

			After the day of hiking, I only re-confirmed that the North Cascades are my favorite place.  I'm convinced that the car commercials showing the windy roads through the trees in the mountains are filmed in Washington, it is so beautiful!

			<p>It is interesting to see the difference in tracks considering I hiked the same trail up (blue) and back down (red) and used the same GPS unit the entire time for tracking my trail.  It puts the GPS error in perspective.</p>
