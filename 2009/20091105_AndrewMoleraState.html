			<h1>Andrew Molera State Park 11-5-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			The second hike of the day took us about 8 miles north to <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=582">Andrew Molera</a> state park.  After coming to my senses and applying some sunscreen in the warm, sunny weather, we embarked.  Not more than a few feet into the <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=25208">hike</a> we encountered a surprising sight – a rather swift Big Sur <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9358">river</a>.  We took off our shoes and socks, I detached the lower section of my hiking <a href="http://www.thenorthface.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=10816&amp;storeId=207&amp;catalogId=10201&amp;langId=-1&amp;from=subCat&amp;parent_category_rn=11721&amp;variationId=395%E2%80%9D">pants</a> (thank goodness for zip-off convertible pants), and we waded across the river.  The water was very cold when I initially submerged my feet, but I quickly forgot about the temperature and was carefully making my way <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9342">across the river</a>, trying to avoid stepping on large rocks.  The water came to just over my knees, I don’t think stepping stones would have worked for crossing.  I believe there is a bridge during the summer for an easier crossing.
			</p>
			<p>
			We continued hiking <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9357">without our shoes and socks</a>, taking some time to dry off and enjoy the sandy path.  Soon the path turned rocky and we put our shoes and socks back on to continue to the beach.  There was really no elevation gain.  We went through some meadows with <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9355">mountains</a> behind us.  We came upon a group of 5 </span> <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9354">deer</a>.  It looked like one doe and 4 young ones.  We finally heard the waves of the ocean and after making our way through some trees, found ourselves on the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9351">beach</a>.  There was a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9352">log</a> with several shoes nearby, none of them being pairs.  We were curious how only one shoe could be lost, especially a hiking boot.
			</p>
			<p>
			After grabbing some PB&amp;J for lunch we continued a little further along the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9348">bluffs</a>.  Watching the time, we turned around after maybe a quarter mile or more and started back to the car.  We took a different trail back which was nice for different <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9343">scenery</a>.  After crossing the river again and just over 3 miles of hiking, we were back at the car and ready for our next adventure of the day.
