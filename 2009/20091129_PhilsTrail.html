			<h1>Phils Trail - Thrush Gap Loop 11-29-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			I had hoped to get a couple of hikes in during the long Thanksgiving break weekend, but I was enjoying relaxing on the couch either watching movies or napping way too much.  Although I woke up late yet again on Sunday, it was early enough to get a shorter hike in.  I made my stop at Safeway for gas and started off the day on a bad foot when the gas pump didn't automatically shut off and gas went spilling onto the pavement - grrr, wasted gas.  The hike I decided to do was suppose to be 5 miles long on Squak Mountain.  The trailhead is actually only a few miles from where I lived in Renton a few summers ago.
			</p>
			<p>
			There were a few cars at the trailhead and a couple of people getting horses ready for a ride.  Unfortunately I was not quick enough and the horses set off before me.  Soon I caught up, but the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9645">horses</a> were large, smelly animals that make it hard to pass so I had to fall inline behind them.  I soon found out that I hate hiking near horses.  I took unnecessary breaks to try and distance myself but I usually caught up.  Another pet peeve is that fido's owners are expected to pick up after fido along the trail, but horse owners aren't expected to do the same.  And a horse's pile is much larger than Fido's pile.  Finally, we came upon a tree  across the trail.  The top of the tree was at or just above my waist and was apparently high enough to stop the horses.  They turned back and I gladly continued horse free.
			</p>
			<p>
			There were several <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9640">creeks</a> running on the mountainside and they were surprisingly loud.  When I would finally get a glimpse of the noisy water, it was always a lot smaller than I expected.  There were a lot of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9641">signs</a> along the trail, probably because there were a lot of junctions.  I just followed the signs on the way to Central Peak.  I had my hiking guide book with me but the mileage differed from that posted on the signs, so I was getting confused about where I was, and thus, which forks to take.  After passing through a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9639">hiker's gate</a>, I soon entered a different world.  The trail became more narrow and more green.  After a little way, I thought I had taken the wrong trail.  I decided to continue another quarter mile just in case, and before the end of that I found another trail junction and sign, assuring me I was headed in the right direction on the right path.
			</p>
			<p>
			I entered a more dense forest that seemed eerie. It seemed darker, possibly having to due with the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9633">fog</a> I encountered, and there were many more fallen trees than throughout the rest of the hike.  I kept looking for the Bullitt Lodge remnants mentioned in my book but thought I had missed the fireplace.  I finally made it to the Bullitt Fireplace trail mentioned in my book and soon found myself at a giant <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9632">fireplace</a>, it was really quite grand.
			</p>
			<p>
			Less than a half mile from the fireplace I finally made it to the top of Central Peak, and got to see all of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9615">radio towers</a> up there. I back tracked 0.1 miles to the junction with Old Griz trail, to continue back down the mountain to my car.  After 0.6 miles on that, I came to another junction with the Phils Trail and continued on that.  I had to hike for just over a quarter mile along the service access <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9627">road</a>, but luckily I jumped back on the trail, soon completing the loop and backtracking down the trail the rest of the way.
			</p>
			<p>
			Near the trailhead, by where the trail crosses the service access road, is another little trail - the Pretzel Loop interpretive trail.  I decided to go check out what the board said and much to my surprise, found a delightful <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9645#9626">story</a> about a field mouse, great for engaging children.  After completing that loop I finally made it back to the trailhead and took off for home.  Only 3.5 miles left until I hit my 200 mile mark.
