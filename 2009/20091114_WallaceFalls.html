			<h1>Wallace Falls 11-14-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			I wanted to get in 10 miles of hiking Saturday.  I'm trying to make it to 200 miles for the year and after Saturday, I'm at 180.  Unfortunately time was going to be my enemy.  I arrived at the busy trailhead just before 1:30 PM.  There were several other groups starting at about the same time.  One large group of 8 young boys with two fathers was worrisome because I did not want to get stuck behind them.  Large groups are always harder to pass.  My hiking book suggested taking the Woody trail at the junction about 0.4 miles into the hike, so I did that.  The other trail, the Old Railroad Grade, I would save for the hike back to the car.  Woody trail followed the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9562">Wallace river</a> with several small waterfalls.  There were three main waterfalls that made up the 'Wallace Falls' hike, and they were so creatively named the lower, middle, and upper falls.
			</p>
			<p>
			The trail was very well maintained with <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9563">wooden gates</a> to keep out bikers, numerous <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9557">bridges</a>, and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9559">benches</a> along the trail.  There was great signage including mile markers and trail maps.  There was even an inspirational <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9565">quote</a> as you started on the trails in the trees.  I passed several volunteers, doing trail maintenance, that I presume were part of the <a href="http://wta.org/">Washington Trails Association</a> due to the WTA on their helmets.  The group of boys was good motivation to keep going at a good pace, despite stopping to take way points on my GPS and a few pictures.  I arrived at the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9552">lower falls</a>.  I think the middle falls, which are <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9553">visible</a>, steal the show at the lower falls.  I got a few good pictures and just as I was leaving the group of boys showed up.  I took off for the middle falls, passing people all along the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9550">way</a>.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9549">middle falls</a> are the most grandiose of the three, falling 265 feet.  There was a family at the view point but I managed to get a couple pictures without them in the way, and continued to the upper falls.  This last stretch was suppose to gain 500' in half a mile but it really didn't seem that bad.  The elevation was gained over a series of <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9547">switchbacks</a>.  The <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9539">upper falls</a> were definitely worth the extra hike as they were gushing pretty well.  There was a short trail that connected the Woody trail to another trail that lead to Wallace Lake.  I decided to continue on for another mile so that I could hit my 10 miles target.

			At the upper trails there was a sign warning people from continuing on, stating the path was hard to follow and that it was still another 2 miles to the lake.  The path was not as well maintained but there were <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9538">blue diamonds</a> over the short distance that were very easy to follow.  After a few hundred yards and a couple hundred feet in elevation, I reached the trail to the lake.  It appeared to be an <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9537">old road</a> so it was very wide and flat.  It was close to 3 PM and according to my GPS the sun was suppose to be setting at 4:30 PM so I didn't have much time to hike another 5 - 6 miles.  I ran part of the way, easy to do on the flat trail.  I made it a mile down at 3:12  PM- I had told myself that I would turn around at 3:15 PM.  Making it back to the trail, it was easy to run down the switchbacks as long as people let me pass which everyone was nice enough to do.  I was making good time, traveling back down the elevation.  I reached the one trail junction and took the old Railroad Grade trail for a change in scenery and an extra mile.  My legs were already sore and the trail really had a very gradual grade so I painstakinly just walked at a brisk pace.  I had already run a half mile to a whole mile, which doesn't sound like a lot, but I had a pack with added weight and I had already hiked about 6 or 7 miles that day.  Finally I made it to the parking lot as dusk was approaching.  I threw my bag in my car and just drove with my hiking boots still on because it was so nice to sit down.  I'd like to go back and do the hike to the lake sometime, maybe later this year when everything else is snowed in.

			One interesting thing about this trail were the mileage markers throughout.  It was a good way to compare the trip odometer on my GPS and it definitely lagged.  Some of the way points on the google map show both the mileage marker distance and what the GPS had.
