			<h1>Icicle Creek 12-5-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			I had ordered a ‘birthday present’ for myself (I’m really good at that) from REI during their winter sale, a pair of <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/690363">snowshoes</a>.  I tried snowshoeing for the first time last March when Ashley was visiting.  We went to Snoqualmie Pass and went on a short 1.5 hour Ranger led <a href="http://snowshoeing-snoqualmie-pass.com/">snowshoe walk</a>.  I had a blast and really liked the snow shoes we had, so when I saw them on sale at REI for $100 I acted.  Renting snow shoes from REI is about $20 for a member, so I figured if I go snow shoeing 5 times over the next few years the purchase will be worth while.  Anyways, I picked up my snow shoes on Wednesday and Thursday night at soccer another friend named Ashley was talking about going snowshoeing that Saturday with her husband Dan.  She graciously invited me along to snow shoe to Eagle Creek near Leavenworth to see the Bald Eagles.  I was so excited to go on my first ‘real’ snowshoe trip.  Unfortunately there was not enough snow along the trail they were planning to follow so we decided to still head to Leavenworth but instead do a short hike and then enjoy the town.
			</p>
			<p>
			I woke up at 5 AM on Saturday to meet Ashley and Dan at the park and ride near the I-90 and I-405 interchange at 6 AM - yeah, I still don’t understand waking up earlier on the weekend then I do during the week for work, but chalk it up to my sacrifices for enjoying nature :-)  Dan drove since he has 4WD and thank goodness.  After arriving in Leavenworth and taking a couple pit stops, one to the visitor center, we made our way down Icicle Creek road to hike along the Icicle Creek Gorge trail.  The friendly woman at the visitor center informed us the road was closed about 1 mile from the trailhead but that was OK with us.  The last few miles of the road were through a lot of snow and the 4WD even had ‘fun’ making it through the snow.  I definitely would have had to turn back if I was in Vinni.  It was pretty chilly in town when getting out of the car – probably near 20 degrees.  Fortunately it didn’t seem as cold on the trail.  We were planning on only going a short distance so we left our packs in the car but grabbed our cameras and gloves/hats/scarves.

			There were snowmobile tracks so we followed those since it created a nice, compact surface to walk along.  The creek had some large  sections and walking through the white winter wonderland was amazing with mountains and blue skies surrounding us.  We hiked down to the edge of the creek and proceeded to try and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9706">break</a> some ice but after all the effort we only got a few <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9704">cracks</a> and some small sections on the very edge to break off. After standing in one spot for 10 or so minutes, we were pretty cold and decided to head back to the car. I actually would have welcomed some more serious elevation to get my body working and my heart pumping to generate some heat. We hiked just over 2 miles, but still shy of my 200 mile goal. I had 1.3 miles left!

			During the couple hours we were gone, the town had changed and was quite <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9698">crowded/busy</a>.  We parked in a parking lot along with 5 other school buses, filled with kids.  I also saw a few charter buses full of people too.  Leavenworth in the winter is like the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9697">embodiment of Christmas</a> tucked away in the mountains.  I did a little Christmas shopping and we grabbed lunch at a local German restaurant, the Bären Haus. We were treated to an acapella group sing off, the men versus the women.  It was a little unbelievable that there were random people singing Christmas carols as they sat at their table – and the groups were good too!  After we finished eating and left the restaurant, we saw just how crowded it had become - the street was a sea of people.  We poked around in a few more <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9700">stores</a>, stopped by the Gingerbread shop for cookies, and found some spots for the lighting ceremony.  After a lot of talking, a ceremonial canon firing, and Miss Autumn singing Silent Night in both English und auf Deutsche (in German) they finally lit up the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9695">park</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9694">buildings</a>.  In hopes of avoiding some traffic and warming up, we headed to join the line for a bakery serving pretzels and hot chocolate, among other things.  After finishing up our yummy treats we emerged to <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9691">snow</a>!  It made the night perfect – a little German town in the mountains, with Christmas lights everywhere and it was <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9690">snowing</a>!  They had several <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9689">fire</a> sources (barrels, bonfire pits, tall stands) throughout the streets so we took in some heat on the way back to the car.  Unfortunately that magical snow falling made the drive home slow through the mountains passes.  I finally arrived home just after 9:30PM, after a long but fun day in the mountains getting in the Christmas spirit.
