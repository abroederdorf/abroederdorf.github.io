			<h1>Heybrook Lookout 11-14-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			The weather forecast for Saturday morning had sunshine - there was not suppose to be any rain/snow until 4 PM or later.  While I was in California and over the past week, a lot of snow had fallen in the mountains so I wasn't sure I'd be able to find anywhere to hike. Two of the local ski resorts opened, that's how much snow we've gotten.  I checked trip reports from the past week, I looked at <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/mbs/conditions/road-trail-conditions.shtml">road and trail conditions</a> on the national forest website, and I checked <a href="http://www.nwac.us/">avalanche reports</a>.  I wanted to stay on the west side of the mountains to avoid going through the passes which were pretty snowy via the <a href="http://wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/passes/">webcams</a> Friday.  I finally decided on three possible hikes along highway 2.  I had Wallace Falls and Heybrook Lookout in mind for an early December's day worth of hiking, but I thought those should work.  I also found Barclay Lake.  Since Wallace Falls looked pretty accessible and I could extend the hike to 10 miles by going to Wallace Lake, I thought I would save that for another day and decided to tackle Barclay Lake and Heybrook Lookout.

			I got a later start than I had hoped for, waking up 3 hours after my alarm went off.  It worked out because I got to stop by the bank to get a few rolls of quarters for laundry.  It was also nice to drive in the sunshine with the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9532">snowy mountains</a> in the distance.  I found my way to the forest service road across from the convenience store in the settlement of Baring.  There was one pick up truck waving me around and another one that turned onto the road just after me.  After a few potholes, I thought the forest service road was in pretty good condition for what I've been driving on the past month or so.  I was excited when I hit the elevation where there was some snow on the trees and along the one lane gravel/dirt road.  There were already <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9529">tire tracks</a> in the snow so I was following those up.  I came to a section where the tracks stopped but I decided to keep going, the snow didn't look that deep.  I was taking a few pictures along the way of all the pretty white snow on the road and trees and I stopped to get this one picture with a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9528">mountain</a> - bad idea.  After losing all of my momentum, I couldn't get going again on the mountainside.  My car, Vinni (a 2 wheel drive Nissan Versa), doesn't go in snow if he is on an incline.  I tried backing up but instead found myself partially in a ditch.  My heart sunk, I thought for sure I was stuck in the snow and those trucks were no longer right behind me, I thought they had turned around.  After some more maneuvering, I reversed enough that I could get some traction in my already made tire tracks and started moving again just as the pickup trucks reappeared behind me.  I learned my lesson, no more stopping until I was at the trailhead.

			I was going along pretty well, the snow was getting deeper.  I finally hit one section that I just couldn't make my way through the snow.  I was spinning my wheels and making no progress.  I tried reversing and seeing if I could drive up my tracks, building momentum but I wasn't going any further.  I started backing down the mountain with the pickup trucks having to back up as well.  They finally got to a section that the truck could kind of pull off to the side, so both trucks passed me.  I almost thought about trying to follow in their tracks  but I thought forget it, I just want to get down off of this mountain - even though I was probably 0.5 miles from the trailhead.  Since the snow was deep, I was trying to drive only in the already made tracks for fear of getting stuck in the snow again.  Unfortunately that meant there was no good place to turn around so I could drive down the mountain facing forward, besides the fact that the road was really just one lane.  I took a few pictures of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9527">surrounding</a> mountains with all of the pretty snow, and proceeded to back down the mountain.  After a very tense mile or so, I came to a little gathering of trees that I noticed on the way up.  The snow wasn't as deep here, I could see a little bit of the rock below, so I decided this was my chance to turn the car around.  Since the road was so narrow and I didn't feel like falling down the mountainside or getting stuck in the ditch, I made about a 20 point turn (think <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLKR9tCiwvA">Austin Powers</a>) and finally got myself facing the right way.  Driving down a mountain in the snow facing forward is so much less nerve racking than reversing down the mountain.  I took a couple more pictures of the snowy <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9525">wonderland</a> as I decided to drive to the trailhead of Heybrook Lookout.
			</p>
			<p>
			This trailhead was right along highway 2 so I had already passed it and knew that there was no snow to get in my way. I really need to break in my new hiking boots, new being that I've had them for about 9 months, so I decided that the 2 mile hike was my perfect opportunity.  I grabbed my pack, turned on the GPS, grabbed a cliff bar for some energy, and hit the trail.  The hike was mostly through a very green, &lt; href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9520"&gt;mossy forest.  It was an elevation gain of about 850 feet just over a mile, so it was a good short workout.  There was <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9515">snow lining</a> most of the upper portion of the trail and the trees were having fun raining/snowing/<a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9517">sleeting</a> on me.  I actually put the pack cover on my backpack because so much water (in its various phases) was falling.
			</p>
			<p>
			I made it to this little clearing with a view of Mt Index across highway 2, and being the sucker that I am for snow covered mountains, I took a few pictures.  I finally looked behind me to see where the trail went and was surprised to find myself just feet away from the base of the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9510">lookout tower</a>.  I've come to learn that my GPS's trip odometer is many times way off.  I thought I was only about half way through the hike and was surprised to gain so much elevation in a short distance.  The GPS does a good job with elevation, just not distance.  Luckily MotionBased seems to correct that when I upload my track logs.  I hurried to the base of the tower, encountering people <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9508">camping</a> near by.  As I climbed the steps up the lookout tower I realized it was a rather large group camping at the base.
			</p>
			<p>
			I finally reached the top of the lookout tower, well almost the top.  The very top level with the little room was closed off but the level below that had a great <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9509">viewing deck</a> that I took several pictures from.  The clouds were rolling through so the peaks were sometimes hidden but I still got some good <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9499">panoramas</a> of all the snowy mountains.  I even saw saw <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9496">blue sky</a> to the east.  After taking <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9507">my</a> share of pictures I climbed back down the tower and proceeded to my car.  I didn't meet anyone on my hike up until the very end when I saw some of the campers, but I passed three small groups of people on my way back down.  The trail was pretty well maintained and it was a great short hike with a very rewarding view at the end.
