			<h1>Little Si 12-6-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			I slept in Sunday after a long day the day before, so I didn’t get up until about 11 AM.  I was just going to stay at home but that 200 mile goal was right in front of my face.  By time I decided I should go hike I knew I wouldn’t leave until about 12, so I had to find a shorter hike that was close by since the sun sets just after 4 PM right now.  I had 3 hikes on my calendar to finish up the year.  I had originally planned to do Poo Poo Point but that was the longest of the three at 7.2 miles round trip.  Little Si and West Tiger 3 are both 5 miles, but Little Si is only 1200’ in elevation gain compared to West Tiger 3’s 2000’ so I chose Little Si.  I had done Mt Si on Memorial Day so I decided its little sibling would be a good December hike.

			I pulled into the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9753">overflow</a> parking lot and was surprised there were only a couple of other cars.  I didn’t realize it was the overflow lot when I pulled in though.  It wasn’t until after I hiked about a tenth of a mile that I found myself in the regular parking lot with a nice trailhead, complete with privy.  I had a few hours for my hike so I started off right away.  Unfortunately, in my haste to pack up my car the morning before, I closed the mouth piece of my water bladder in the door and broke it, so I had to use the old fashion water bottles.  It’s not nearly as convenient to drink while hiking, mostly because if I’m moving I tend to spill a lot of the water.  The trail was busy but moderately so.  I passed people every so often but I was always able to find a little sphere of space to hike in by myself.  It was much better than my Wallace Falls hike for example.

			I was keeping a close eye on my GPS so I knew when I hit my 200 mile mark!  It was about a fourth of the way into the hike and I of course took a few pictures to capture the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9746">moment</a>.  It was just after seeing a <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9747">mountain goat</a> that a couple of hikers had told me about.  The trail was well kept but not too well kept so that I still felt like an <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9745">explorer</a> in the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9744">forest</a>.  The beginning and end of the hike is where most of the elevation is gained, which makes for a nice break in the middle.  I made it to the top and took a few pictures of nearby <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9741">Mt Si</a> and <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9752">Rattlesnake Ledge</a> in the distance across <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9734">I-90</a>.  There was a loop on the trail but I decided I cared more to get down the mountain and back to my car before sunset then to add an extra mile or so to my hike.  I think Little Si will be added to my quick after work hike list to mix it up with Rattlesnake Ledge every so often.  One hiking goal is completed for the year - 200 miles.  Now to reach my 10 miles in elevation gain, I’m at just over 9 miles.  My last two hikes for the year should get me there though.
