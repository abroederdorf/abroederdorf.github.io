			<h1>West Tiger #3 12-13-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			I got home about noon after having <a href="http://www.bethscafe.com/">breakfast</a> with Kyle, a friend from A&amp;M, and showing him around Seattle a little since he just moved up to Washington.  Noon is a little late in the day to try and go hike still, at least during this time of year, since I still had to drive to the mountains and finish my hike before sunset around 4 PM.  I debated for about 5 or 10 minutes and then decided to pack up and change into some hiking clothes quick.  For the past 11 weeks I had gone on at least one hike and I was not ready to stop that trend during week 12.  I think I left my apartment about 12:30 PM and headed for exit 20 on I-90 to hike to the summit of West Tiger #3.  This was my other 5 mile hike tentatively scheduled for the month so I figured it gave me the best chance of finishing before sunset, opposed to my other proposed hike of just over 7 miles.

			I had done the 5 miles to the top of Little Si a week before, easily within the shortened time frame.  However, that hike only had an elevation gain of about 1100’ while West Tiger #3 has a gain of 2000’, almost twice that of Little Si.  The 0.5 miles of dirt road to the trailhead parking lot was surprisingly filled with pot holes – unfortunately for Vinni too.  There were several cars parked outside the gate, and as I figured I’d have 3 hours to complete the 5 miles, I wondered if I should have joined them there.  There were several cars in the parking lot at the trailhead.  I pulled up, got my GPS up and running, and hit the trail with guidebook in hand.  There was another guy that started out just before me, but once I got on the West Tiger #3 trail it was fairly peaceful.  I spent the first half mile or so reading the trail description so I knew what to expect.
			</p>
			<p>
			The trail was in good condition and was easily <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9805">wide</a> enough for 2 people, maybe 2.5 even.  There were several hiking pairs, however, that I met that did not fall into a single file line to allow me easy passing which disappointed me.  Most hikers are so considerate but I had apparently found the 10 or so that are not.  I was still able to pass but I had to squeeze by on the edge of the trail.  It’s not that inconvenient to fall into line for 20 feet to allow other people easy passing, especially when people hiking up are suppose to have the right of way.  The majority of the hikers I passed were considerate and we exchanged smiles and pleasant greetings.  I had a few people pass me on the way up as I stopped for water breaks.  I kept a close eye on my GPS, calculating how long it would take me to get to the summit based on my current pace.  I set a turn back time of 3:00PM and felt OK with that even if I didn’t make it to the top.  As I went I started to get optimistic that I might even summit by 2:45 PM, giving me more time to get back down the mountain.  That’s one nice thing about a steep hike, it’s quick going downhill if you let gravity help you – as long as the trail isn’t too steep.    The trail wound its way through the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9802">trees</a>, but the scenery wasn’t all that interesting.  Other than the turns in the trail itself, the scenery stayed consistent.  For this hike I was more focused on finishing in time then taking in the scenery so it probably helped that it was a little more boring so that I didn’t stop to take as many pictures.

			There were some <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9801">light snow</a> flakes throughout my hike, but as I neared the summit the snow picked up.  I reached the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9797">summit</a> by 2:30, just a little over 1 hour and 15 minutes after I started, and was in a cloud.  I couldn’t see any surroundings and the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9796">snow</a> was coming down pretty hard.  I took a few pictures and started back down the trail, now worried about getting down the mountain before too much snow fell and I couldn’t drive out of the parking lot.  My view of the surrounding mountains was significantly <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9794">obscured</a> by the snow, which wasn’t the case 10 minutes <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9799">earlier</a> when I had gone by the same point.  For the first half mile I met no one on the trail which was a little weird, and I picked up my pace.  I half jogged down about a mile and a half, making some good time.  I eventually did start meeting people, several of which were actually still hiking up.  The trail, which initially had <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9800">little</a> signs of snow, had a light <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9795">dusting </a>covering everything.  I made it back to the trailhead in just under an hour, completing the 5 miles in just over 2 hours which I was very pleased with.  I’m not a fast hiker by any means, but was happy I could keep my pretty normal pace with a steeper trail.  The parking lot did have a light covering of snow, but luckily I only had to endure that for the half mile back to the paved road.  It was a great, short afternoon hike and I am now less than 1,000’ away from my goal of hiking 10 miles in elevation.  One more hike in Washington before I head back to Chicago for Christmas – that is if the weather cooperates and I can get to the mountains.
