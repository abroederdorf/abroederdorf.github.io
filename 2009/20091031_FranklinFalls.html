			<h1>Franklin Falls 10-31-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			I was ready for another weekend of hiking.  I had been keeping a close eye on the weather reports, like I usually do, hoping for some nice weather for the weekend.  I really like the weather forecast from <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=47.43656417876443&amp;lon=-121.45797729492188&amp;site=sew&amp;smap=1&amp;marine=0&amp;unit=0&amp;lg=en">NOAA</a> (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).  You can select a specific area on the Google map and get the 7 day forecast.  It’s nice because most of my hikes are not very close to a town that I can get a forecast for.  Saturday was calling for rain and Sunday was supposed to be partly cloudy.  I was kind of excited to try out my new rain gear, my <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/721771">Helly Hansen rain pants</a> and my <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/778451">REI Traverse 30</a> backpack for women.  I had technically used my new pack the previous weekend for my hikes in the North Cascades, but they were on a beautiful day so I didn’t have a reason to try the built in pack cover.  To complete my rain gear I also had my new-ish shell (rain jacket), the <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/outdoorgear/Backcountry-Stoic-20-Shell-Womens/BCC0148M.html?avad=397_f523e15">Stoic 2.0 Shell</a> for women and my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-WP-DC13-Waterproof-SD1000-Digital/dp/B000NSIKI8">waterproof camera case</a>, which I always think makes my camera look like a toy.  The case is big and bulky but at least I get to keep taking pictures.  I’ve gotten a lot of ‘Oh, that’s a good idea’ comments from hikers that I pass on the trail, too.

			For Saturday hiking I decided to go towards Snoqualmie Pass for a couple of hikes.  I would start with Franklin Falls and then drive a quarter mile to the trailhead for Melakwa Lake after.  Sunday I had been planning on hiking to Wallace Falls off of Highway 2 but since my boots were soaked, I still had blisters, and I like sleeping, I made the decision to waste a gorgeous day and stay home until football later that afternoon (which by the way, we won our playoff game with a comeback drive in the last 12 seconds of the game and I threw the game winning touchdown pass, although really it was my teammate who managed to come down with the catch).  Back to Saturday though, I think one of the two trail sites I usually check (<a href="http://www.wta.org/">Washington Trails Association</a> and <a href="http://www.pnwhikes.com/">Pacific Northwest Hikes</a>) had a special article on waterfall hikes, and since we all know how much I like waterfalls, I added most of the hikes to my to-do list of hikes.  Franklin Falls was one of those hikes and since it was close to Melakwa Lake, which I had heard of, I decided to combine the two.  Franklin Falls is only a 2 mile hike while Melakwa Lake is 9 miles round trip.

			I haven’t been doing as well lately with leaving early in the morning as I always intend.  I think I got in my car about 7:45 am and it took just over an hour to arrive at the trailhead.  I took exit 47 on I-90 and drove another 3 miles or so east on forest roads to the trailhead for Franklin Falls.  The trails are near the Denny Creek campground.  It’s like a little oasis between east and westbound I-90, I couldn’t believe it.  And luckily the hike to Franklin Falls, which follows I-90 closely, had the South Fork Snoqualmie River that drowned out any car sounds.

			It wasn’t actually raining yet but everything was pretty wet and the trees were dripping on me. I had assumed it would be raining all day so I already had my rain pants and jacket on.  The trail was very nice despite the wetness and water.  There were some pretty large puddles and it was a little muddy, but I can imagine during the dry summer months that this trail is a treat to hike, especially with Franklin Falls as the final destination.  The river was flowing very fast, I was actually quite surprised.   One section of the trail had been overtaken by the river and was completely <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9196">submerged</a> so I reluctantly hiked off trail around the 5 – 10 foot section (I try to always avoid ‘<a href="http://www.lnt.org/programs/principles_2.php">meadow stomping</a>’).  It seemed like there was water flowing from every which way into the already raging river.  There were quite a few nice little waterfalls along the river.  The elevation gain was very moderate; I think maybe 400’ in total.  Before I knew it I was descending the last 50 feet of the rocky trail to the pool at the base of the waterfall.  <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/videos/35">Franklin Falls</a> was quite a sight!  It was much better than I anticipated.  It also surprised me to see I-90 right next to the waterfall, just above it.  For all the times I have driven on I-90, I never knew that Franklin Falls existed.  After a few pictures of the falls I headed back down the trail to my car, to continue on for my second hike of the day.  The hike to Franklin Falls was really nice and a great way to warm up for my day of hiking.

			I learned last weekend that MotionBased would only upload my current track log so when I created plots of distance, elevation, time, and speed it included both hikes.  I used my awesome MS Paint skills to split the plots and post them with their respective hike.  Bring on the nerd data!

			<h3 class="statsTitle">Stats</h3>
			<p class="tab1">The GPS was acting up during my hikes.  For instance, I supposedly was only moving for 19 minutes and stopped for 40 minutes.  It would suddenly pick up that I moved so my speed would be 8 mph.  Bottom line, take these stats with a grain of salt.  I tried to put more appropriate approximate values in.</p>
