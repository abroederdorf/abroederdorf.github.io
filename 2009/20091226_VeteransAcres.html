			<h1>Veterans Acres 12-26-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			Christmas time was upon us so I caught a flight back to Chicago and surprisingly made it with no delays.  I seriously kept watching the board at the airport waiting for something to show since freezing rain was expected in Chicago.  In fact, the airports had already put out a statement and policy regarding the Midwest storm.  Lucky for me, the weather was pretty good in Seattle and I landed on time at O’Hare.  Even though I was a couple thousand miles away from ‘my’ mountains, I still wanted to get outside while I was home.  And why not continue my new routine of doing some sort of hiking every weekend? What better way to end 2009?  I had already met all of my goals which is good since there is not much opportunity for hiking close to home in Illinois.  It was nice though because I could just enjoy myself too.
			</p>
			<p>
			Before flying home, I had already decided to do my hiking at Veterans Acres (VA), my favorite park in the area.  During a business trip home at the end of July, I actually did a little <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/7393">hiking</a> there with my Mom too.  I was hoping there would be snow around so I packed my hiking gear.  My hiking pants were a much better travel option for romping around in the snow compared to my actual snow pants used for skiing.  No matter how many times I got covered in snow, my hiking pants stayed dried.  There was snow on the ground still from a storm a couple weeks earlier.  The temperatures had stayed cold so it wasn’t melting fast.  Given my schedule, I decided on the day after Christmas for my hike.  I woke up to snow and was excited because I decided to do some sledding at VA as well, something I haven’t done in about 6+ years.  It is the best sledding hill in town. I grabbed the trusty old <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9906">orange plastic sled</a> from my early childhood and slowly made my way on the snowy roads to the park.  We have great snow removal capability in Illinois, but it was snowing so hard that the plows couldn’t keep up.  In fact, my Mom called to tell me the snow plow guy plowed the driveway just after I left, but when I got home 3 – 4 hours later, I would have had no idea.  I think the total for the day was 10+ inches.
			</p>
			<p>
			I got to VA and was surprised to find it relatively <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9915">quiet</a>.  There were several families but from past experience, I expected a lot more people.  I threw on a couple more shirts, grabbed the sled, and went down the hill a few times.  They had chutes constructed from fence at the top, to try and preserve some order so that people weren’t ‘bowling’ with each other as they went down the hill.  For some reason I could not get down the hill without spinning, and I wasn’t even on a disc!  I took a series of pictures on my way down one time, thanks to my <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9914">continuous</a> shoot feature, and you can see how much snow <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9912">sprayed</a> up at me.  It felt like the old snow had frozen pretty solid underneath, probably from the freezing rain, and the new snow was a real light powder.  After I had satisfied the little kid inside, I grabbed a drawstring backpack I borrowed from my Mom, threw a bottle of water in, and took off for the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9907">trails</a>.  I still took my sled, hoping to get some ‘backcountry’ sledding in, and I of course had along my trusty GPS.

			VA is an interesting place to go hiking because there are so many trails it’s sometimes hard to figure out where you are exactly.  I stayed to the main trails instead of venturing through all of the trees on the boot beaten paths (which I couldn’t exactly see given the several inches of snow covering them).  I did go <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9898">off</a> a couple times though, to do some sledding.  I got some puzzled looks from cross country skiers as they passed me with my sled.  I really couldn’t believe how hard it was snowing, I seriously was wondering who shook the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9904">snowglobe</a>?  I did manage to find some wildlife along my hike.  There were three <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9903">deer</a> in the distance that crossed my trail.  They were a little hard to see through all of the snow, but they were there.  Definitely white tailed deer too, which I believe are the state mammal of Illinois.  I stopped for a while because they noticed me, but I eventually continued on the trail and they ran back towards the trees.  On my <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9902">first side trail excursion</a> for sledding, I also noticed a squirrel.  As I was walking back to the main trail I noticed a big pile of snow fall from the trees out of the corner of my eye.  I looked up and there was a squirrel jumping from branch to branch, and with each jump letting loose a large pile of snow.  Unfortunately he got away before I could get a picture.  I also found some nice <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9897">berries</a> on trees covered in snow - the hike really was very pretty.
			</p>
			<p>
			I left VA and hiked the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9901">main loop</a> through Sterne’s Woods, encountering the cross country skiers there as well as a couple of families seeking sledding refuge from the busy big hill – or that’s what they told me at least.  I really liked <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9896">sledding</a> on the trails because they created little chutes to go down so I didn’t spin, and of course they were more exciting since there were large obstacles (Trees!) to avoid.  I started back for the car at the top of the big hill.  When I reached the bowl area, the <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9895">hill</a> looked much more like how I remembered it, full of people enjoying the snow.  I opted not to try sledding anymore.  I figured I had had enough fun and I didn’t want to battle with the crowds, so after I used my hands and arms to brush the snow off of the windows, I took off for home.  A fun day in the snow at my favorite Crystal Lake park!
