			<h1>Melakwa Lake 10-31-09</h1>
			
			<p>
			My main hike for Saturday was to Melakwa Lake, 4.5 miles with a 2400’ elevation gain one way.  I had started the day by hiking to Franklin Falls (see post below for more fun background information).  There was a sign at the Franklin Falls trailhead for the Melakwa Lake trailhead being 0.25 miles up the road, so I jumped in my car and drove the quarter mile on a very pothole filled forest road.  When I pulled into the small parking lot at the trailhead, there was a group of three guys getting ready and another older gentleman pulled in behind me.  I started on the trail to realize after a minute or so, that I had forgotten my MP3 player.  For 9 miles of hiking, I wanted my music so I turned around and went back to the car.  While I was at the car I also realized I forgot my trekking poles and sunglasses, so I packed everything up and a few minutes later hit the trail for real.
			</p>
			<p>
			The trail was a little wet with a few good sized puddles near the beginning.  There was a bridge, crossing Denny Creek I am guessing?  It was the only actual bridge I crossed throughout the entire hike but not the only stream/creek/river I crossed.  Not quite half a mile into the hike and I passed under the westbound viaduct of I-90.  This is the closest I have ever been to such a major road while hiking.  I continued on the mostly dirt trail through the trees until I happened upon the creek again, this time <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9237">no bridge</a> in sight.  The older gentleman was just ahead of me and said he was going to turn around and find a new hike.  I pressed on and crossed the old tree lodged just right for us hikers to cross.  Thank goodness for decent balance!  I made it across and continued through the trees for a little while longer.
			</p>
			<p>
			I emerged from the trees into this meadow like field filled with small bushes/trees of which all of the leaves had fallen off already.  Soon I came upon <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9234">Keekwulee Falls</a>, a magnificent waterfall.  The trail had picked up many small boulders/large rocks and maintained that for the next few miles.  On one hand it was good for trying to avoid wet feet, but on the other hand I hated it because they are too big to step on like gravel, so you have to change your stride, usually resulting in a much slower hike - or that was the case for me.  I should probably mention at this point the trail was its own <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9225">small stream</a> with several pools.  These rocks were my stepping stones to avoid soaked feet.  Well, they helped delay the soaking at least.  I was an avid lava tile jumper in grocery stores when I was little (you know, where you avoid certain color tiles, forcing you to jump from good tile to good tile while your Mom is shopping).  I believe this ability developed as a young child greatly assists me in my hiking today.  They should probably add a lava tile event to the Olympics.  OK, back to hiking…
			</p>
			<p>
			After seeing the awesome Keekwulee Falls it was back into the trees for a quick jaunt, and then more hiking along the mountainside in a meadow.  The mist started in, so under the cover of some trees I put my shell back on, covered my pack with its built in cover, and got the waterproof camera case out.  I did that just in time as the mist soon turned to rain.  Finally after a few more switchbacks along the rocky/stream trail I reached another section of trees with a dirt trail and steep switchbacks.  I was getting close as my hiking book listed this section at the 3 – 3.5 mile markers.  Much of the trail through this section had <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9221">snow</a>, which had become quite slushy and slick from the rain.  I finally reached Hemlock Pass, the high point of my hike at 4600’.  From there it was a mile downhill to the lake, while still avoiding some very wet and muddy sections.
			</p>
			<p>
			Victory, I reached Melakwa Lake!  The first thing I noticed was a huge <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9219">log jam</a> where the lake outflowed to a stream.  After taking a couple pictures, the west end of the lake was just calling out for exploration.  I’m not sure why, but I really wanted to hike over there and explore.  My first obstacle was using that log jam as a bridge to cross the stream.  Once across the jam, I followed the path along the mountainside.  To my surprise I found a little stream connecting to another lake!  I had failed to notice Upper Melakwa Lake on the map before my hike.  The extra lake was certainly an unexpected surprise.  I was glad I took the time for some exploration.  I took several more pictures, trying to capture the steep mountainsides surrounding the lakes when the clouds would give me a break.  The water was also this brilliant <a href="http://abroederdorf.shutterfly.com/9203">blue-green</a> color, it was really pretty.  I grabbed a PB&amp;J sandwich for lunch and then started on the trek back to the car.
			</p>
			<p>
			I was pretty impressed with my rain gear, everything except for my feet were dry.  What a difference from my hike to Lake Ingalls a few weeks before.  The hike on the way back to the car seemed to drag on and the rocky trail really made me mad.  I longed for a nice dirt, or even small gravel, trail.  Finally I made it back to the car and headed home, hoping to pass some candy out to cute little trick-or-treaters.
			</p>
			<p>
			The hike to Melakwa Lake is probably my least favorite so far.  Maybe during a drier season when the trail isn’t submerged in water for the majority of time, I’d enjoy it a little more.  Keekwulee Falls and the Melakwa Lakes were pretty, but because of the hike itself, not something I’m racing back to see.  There are plenty of other hikes I’ve been on that I like a lot better.

			I learned last weekend that MotionBased would only upload my current track log so when I created plots of distance, elevation, time, and speed it included both hikes. I used my awesome MS Paint skills to split the plots and post them with their respective hike. Bring on the nerd data!

						<p>The GPS was acting up during my hikes. For instance, I supposedly was only moving for 1.5 hours and stopped for 4 hours. It would suddenly pick up that I moved so my speed would be 8 mph. Bottom line, take these stats with a grain of salt. I tried to put more appropriate approximate values in.</p>
